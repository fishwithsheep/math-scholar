| 2025-03-06 | Matrix H-theory approach to stock market fluctuations | Luan M. T. de Moraes, Ant√¥nio M. S. Macedo, Raydonal Ospina et.al. | [2503.08697](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08697) |  | 26 pages, 10 figures. Published on Physical Review E | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce matrix H theory, a framework for analyzing collective behavior arising from multivariate stochastic processes with hierarchical structure. The theory models the joint distribution of the multiple variables (the measured signal) as a compound of a large-scale multivariate distribution with the distribution of a slowly fluctuating background. The background is characterized by a hierarchical stochastic evolution of internal degrees of freedom, representing the correlations between stocks at different time scales. As in its univariate version, the matrix H-theory formalism also has two universality classes: Wishart and inverse Wishart, enabling a concise description of both the background and the signal probability distributions in terms of Meijer G-functions with matrix argument. Empirical analysis of daily returns of stocks within the S&P500 demonstrates the effectiveness of matrix H theory in describing fluctuations in stock markets. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multivariate hierarchical processes and offer potential for developing more informed portfolio strategies in financial markets.</details> |
| 2025-03-05 | Multimodal Stock Price Prediction: A Case Study of the Russian Securities Market | Kasymkhan Khubiev, Mikhail Semenov et.al. | [2503.08696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08696) |  | NSCF-2024, PROGRAM SYSTEMS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Classical asset price forecasting methods primarily rely on numerical data, such as price time series, trading volumes, limit order book data, and technical analysis indicators. However, the news flow plays a significant role in price formation, making the development of multimodal approaches that combine textual and numerical data for improved prediction accuracy highly relevant. This paper addresses the problem of forecasting financial asset prices using the multimodal approach that combines candlestick time series and textual news flow data. A unique dataset was collected for the study, which includes time series for 176 Russian stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange and 79,555 financial news articles in Russian. For processing textual data, pre-trained models RuBERT and Vikhr-Qwen2.5-0.5b-Instruct (a large language model) were used, while time series and vectorized text data were processed using an LSTM recurrent neural network. The experiments compared models based on a single modality (time series only) and two modalities, as well as various methods for aggregating text vector representations. Prediction quality was estimated using two key metrics: Accuracy (direction of price movement prediction: up or down) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which measures the deviation of the predicted price from the true price. The experiments showed that incorporating textual modality reduced the MAPE value by 55%. The resulting multimodal dataset holds value for the further adaptation of language models in the financial sector. Future research directions include optimizing textual modality parameters, such as the time window, sentiment, and chronological order of news messages.</details> |
| 2025-03-02 | Liquidity-adjusted Return and Volatility, and Autoregressive Models | Qi Deng, Zhong-guo Zhou et.al. | [2503.08693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08693) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely designed liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that incorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we introduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations of traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling illiquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We demonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for cryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and reduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is validated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance (LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.</details> |
| 2025-02-27 | Detecting Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes: A Thresholding-Based Approach to Handling Market Noise | Mahya Karbalaii et.al. | [2503.08692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08692) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a simple yet robust unsupervised model to detect pump-and-dump events on tokens listed on the Poloniex Exchange platform. By combining threshold-based criteria with exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and volatility measures, our approach effectively distinguishes genuine anomalies from minor trading fluctuations, even for tokens with low liquidity and prolonged inactivity. These characteristics present a unique challenge, as standard anomaly-detection methods often over-flag negligible volume spikes. Our framework overcomes this issue by tailoring both price and volume thresholds to the specific trading patterns observed, resulting in a model that balances high true-positive detection with minimal noise.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment? | Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano et.al. | [2503.03612](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | VWAP Execution with Signature-Enhanced Transformers: A Multi-Asset Learning Approach | Remi Genet et.al. | [2503.02680](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02680) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/DynamicVWAPTransformer)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper I propose a novel approach to Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution that addresses two key practical challenges: the need for asset-specific model training and the capture of complex temporal dependencies. Building upon my recent work in dynamic VWAP execution arXiv:2502.18177, I demonstrate that a single neural network trained across multiple assets can achieve performance comparable to or better than traditional asset-specific models. The proposed architecture combines a transformer-based design inspired by arXiv:2406.02486 with path signatures for capturing geometric features of price-volume trajectories, as in arXiv:2406.17890. The empirical analysis, conducted on hourly cryptocurrency trading data from 80 trading pairs, shows that the globally-fitted model with signature features (GFT-Sig) achieves superior performance in both absolute and quadratic VWAP loss metrics compared to asset-specific approaches. Notably, these improvements persist for out-of-sample assets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different market conditions. The results suggest that combining global parameter sharing with signature-based feature extraction provides a scalable and robust approach to VWAP execution, offering significant practical advantages over traditional asset-specific implementations.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market | Katarzyna Chƒôƒá, Bartosz Uniejewski, Rafa≈Ç Weron et.al. | [2503.02518](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</details> |
| 2025-03-01 | Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures | Hari P. Krishnan, Stephan Sturm et.al. | [2503.00603](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603) |  | 19 pages, 1 figure | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead | Richard Gerlach, Antonio Naimoli, Giuseppe Storti et.al. | [2502.20978](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</details> |
| 2025-02-26 | Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph | Shiqi Wang, Zhibo Zhang, Libing Fang et.al. | [2502.19305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305) | **[link](https://github.com/wangskyGit/KeHGN-R)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning ( ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks | Remi Genet et.al. | [2502.18177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/deepdynamicvwap)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | LLM Knows Geometry Better than Algebra: Numerical Understanding of LLM-Based Agents in A Trading Arena | Tianmi Ma, Jiawei Du, Wenxin Huang et.al. | [2502.17967](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967) | **[link](https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/agent-trading-arena)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to generalize to dynamic, unseen tasks, particularly in numerical reasoning, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LLMs on problems with predefined optimal solutions, which may not align with real-world scenarios where clear answers are absent. To bridge this gap, we design the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual numerical game simulating complex economic systems through zero-sum games, where agents invest in stock portfolios. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic reasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local details rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly better with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as scatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance numerical reasoning. This capability is further improved by incorporating the reflection module, which aids in the analysis and interpretation of complex data. We validate our findings on NASDAQ Stock dataset, where LLMs demonstrate stronger reasoning with visual data compared to text. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.git.</details> |
| 2025-02-24 | A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk | Jan Fialkowski, Christian Diem, Andr√°s Borsos et.al. | [2502.17044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044) | **[link](https://github.com/JanFialkowski/FSRI_Plus)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and financial systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-22 | Contrastive Similarity Learning for Market Forecasting: The ContraSim Framework | Nicholas Vinden, Raeid Saqur, Zining Zhu et.al. | [2502.16023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16023) |  | 8 pages, 3 appendices | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce the Contrastive Similarity Space Embedding Algorithm (ContraSim), a novel framework for uncovering the global semantic relationships between daily financial headlines and market movements. ContraSim operates in two key stages: (I) Weighted Headline Augmentation, which generates augmented financial headlines along with a semantic fine-grained similarity score, and (II) Weighted Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (WSSCL), an extended version of classical self-supervised contrastive learning that uses the similarity metric to create a refined weighted embedding space. This embedding space clusters semantically similar headlines together, facilitating deeper market insights. Empirical results demonstrate that integrating ContraSim features into financial forecasting tasks improves classification accuracy from WSJ headlines by 7%. Moreover, leveraging an information density analysis, we find that the similarity spaces constructed by ContraSim intrinsically cluster days with homogeneous market movement directions, indicating that ContraSim captures market dynamics independent of ground truth labels. Additionally, ContraSim enables the identification of historical news days that closely resemble the headlines of the current day, providing analysts with actionable insights to predict market trends by referencing analogous past events.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Multi-Agent Stock Prediction Systems: Machine Learning Models, Simulations, and Real-Time Trading Strategies | Daksh Dave, Gauransh Sawhney, Vikhyat Chauhan et.al. | [2502.15853](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15853) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper presents a comprehensive study on stock price prediction, leveragingadvanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve financial forecasting accuracy. The research evaluates the performance of various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and attention-based models. These models are assessed for their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies inherent in stock market data. Our findings show that attention-based models outperform other architectures, achieving the highest accuracy by capturing both short and long-term dependencies. This study contributes valuable insights into AI-driven financial forecasting, offering practical guidance for developing more accurate and efficient trading systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM) | Tianzuo Hu et.al. | [2502.15822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</details> |

(2024). Network Topology of the Euro Area Interbank Market. In:   Mingione, M., Vichi, M., Zaccaria, G. (eds) *High-quality and Timely   Statistics*. CESS 2022. Studies in Theoretical and Applied Statistics.   Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63630-1_1 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets | Bastien Buchwalter, Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz et.al. | [2502.15458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework | Arno Botha, Tanja Verster, Roland Breedt et.al. | [2502.14479](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479) |  | 33 pages, 8192 words, 12 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</details> |

The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</details> |

| 2025-03-13 | Unifying monitoring and modelling of water concentration levels in surface waters | Peter B Sorensen, Anders Nielsen, Peter E Holm et.al. | [2503.10285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10285) |  | 41 pages, 11 figures, Developed to support the Danish EPA | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Accurate prediction of expected concentrations is essential for effective catchment management, requiring both extensive monitoring and advanced modeling techniques. However, due to limitations in the equation solving capacity, the integration of monitoring and modeling has been suffering suboptimal statistical approaches. This limitation results in models that can only partially leverage monitoring data, thus being an obstacle for realistic uncertainty assessments by overlooking critical correlations between both measurements and model parameters. This study presents a novel solution that integrates catchment monitoring and a unified hieratical statistical catchment modeling that employs a log-normal distribution for residuals within a left-censored likelihood function to address measurements below detection limits. This enables the estimation of concentrations within sub-catchments in conjunction with a source/fate sub-catchment model and monitoring data. This approach is possible due to a model builder R package denoted RTMB. The proposed approach introduces a statistical paradigm based on a hierarchical structure, capable of accommodating heterogeneous sampling across various sampling locations and the authors suggest that this also will encourage further refinement of other existing modeling platforms within the scientific community to improve synergy with monitoring programs. The application of the method is demonstrated through an analysis of nickel concentrations in Danish surface waters.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | A Neumann-Neumann Acceleration with Coarse Space for Domain Decomposition of Extreme Learning Machines | Chang-Ock Lee, Byungeun Ryoo et.al. | [2503.10032](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10032) |  | 21 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Extreme learning machines (ELMs), which preset hidden layer parameters and solve for last layer coefficients via a least squares method, can typically solve partial differential equations faster and more accurately than Physics Informed Neural Networks. However, they remain computationally expensive when high accuracy requires large least squares problems to be solved. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for ELMs have allowed parallel computation to reduce training times of large systems. This paper constructs a coarse space for ELMs, which enables further acceleration of their training. By partitioning interface variables into coarse and non-coarse variables, selective elimination introduces a Schur complement system on the non-coarse variables with the coarse problem embedded. Key to the performance of the proposed method is a Neumann-Neumann acceleration that utilizes the coarse space. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup compared to a previous DDM method for ELMs.</details> |

To address these limitations, this study explores the usage of the newly introduced Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM) network in combination with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for automated stock trading. Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems.</details> |

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</details> |

To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them. Experimental validations on a center console assembly task demonstrate significant improvements in cycle times and robustness compared to conventional robot programming approaches.

| 2025-03-12 | Large-scale Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser Beam Welding Using High-Performance Computing: A Qualitative Reproduction of Experimental Results | Tommaso Bevilacqua, Andrey Gumenyuk, Niloufar Habibi et.al. | [2503.09345](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09345) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Laser beam welding is a non-contact joining technique that has gained significant importance in the course of the increasing degree of automation in industrial manufacturing. This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.   The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</details> |

| 2025-03-11 | Capturing Lifecycle System Degradation in Digital Twin Model Updating | Yifan Tang, Mostafa Rahmani Dehaghani, G. Gary Wang et.al. | [2503.08953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08953) |  | 32 pages, 25 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate monitoring, control, and other decision-making tasks in real-world engineering systems. Online update methods have been proposed to update DT models. Considering the degradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT models to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over time. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters have been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation parameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments. To mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for DT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses without any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system. The core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the lifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters with a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong update process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters of all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into account the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation stage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation stages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables prediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted latent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is reconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system responses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on two engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could capture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle.</details> |

Nathan Kutz et.al. | [2503.08904](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904) | **[link](https://github.com/ermete-lab/nushred)** | arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.12550 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</details> |

Kerswell et.al. | [2503.08283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</details> |

This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</details> |

Tessone et.al. | [2503.07834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07834) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Uniswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automatic token exchange without the need for traditional order books. Every pair of tokens forms a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and each token can be paired with any other token to create liquidity pools. This characteristic motivates us to employ a complex network approach to analyze the features of the Uniswap market. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the Uniswap network using complex network methods. The network on October 31, 2023, is built to observe its recent features, showcasing both scale-free and core-periphery properties. By employing node and edge-betweenness metrics, we detect the most important tokens and liquidity pools. Additionally, we construct daily networks spanning from the beginning of Uniswap V2 on May 5, 2020, until October 31, 2023, and our findings demonstrate that the network becomes increasingly fragile over time. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis by simulating the deletion of nodes to estimate the impact of some extreme events such as the Terra collapse. The results indicate that the Uniswap network exhibits robustness, yet it is notably fragile when deleting tokens with high betweenness centrality. This finding highlights that, despite being a decentralized exchange, Uniswap exhibits significant centralization tendencies in terms of token network connectivity and the distribution of TVL across nodes (tokens) and edges (liquidity pools).</details> |

For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms.   This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Bearing Fault Detection using Piezoelectric Cantilevers | P. Peralta-Braz, M. M. Alamdari, C. T. Chou et.al. | [2503.07462](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07462) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, yet their vulnerability to faults often leads to costly breakdowns. Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.</details> |

| 2025-03-10 | An Analytics-Driven Approach to Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning | Ge Zheng, Alexandra Brintrup et.al. | [2503.07231](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07231) |  | 15 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to a journal | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In today's globalised trade, supply chains form complex networks spanning multiple organisations and even countries, making them highly vulnerable to disruptions. These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.</details> |

The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$ -consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case. Through different numerical applications involving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation possesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex systems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy.</details> |

With digital fabrication technology, this study explores the transition from traditional, single function building facades to multifunctional, integrated building systems. It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) fa\c{c}ade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation. This research introduces a novel approach by designing the fa\c{c}ade system as modular, user-friendly and transportation-friendly bricks, enabling the creation of a user-customized and self-assembled photobioreactor (PBR) system. The single module in the system is proposed to be "neutralization bricks", which embedded with algae and equipped with an air circulation system, facilitating the photobioreactor (PBR)'s functionality. A connection system between modules allows for easy assembly by users, while a limited variety of brick styles ensures modularity in manufacturing without sacrificing customization and diversity. The system is also equipped with an advanced microalgae status detection algorithm, which allows users to monitor the condition of the microalgae using monocular camera. This functionality ensures timely alerts and notifications for users to replace the algae, thereby optimizing the operational efficiency and sustainability of the algae cultivation process.</details> |

These power losses not only increase end-to-end latency, but also compromise inference consistency and accuracy, as existing checkpointing and restore mechanisms are prone to errors. Consequently, the quality of service (QoS) for DNN inference on EH devices is severely impacted. In this paper, we propose an energy-adaptive DNN inference mechanism capable of dynamically transitioning the model into a low-power mode by reducing computational complexity when harvested energy is limited. This approach ensures that end-to-end latency requirements are met. Additionally, to address the limitations of error-prone checkpoint-and-restore mechanisms, we introduce a checkpoint-free intermittent inference framework that ensures consistent, progress-preserving DNN inference during power failures in energy-harvesting systems.</details> |

We use a proven setup as the foundation for our environment with multiple extensions. The features of our trading agent are constantly being expanded to include additional assets such as commodities, resulting in four models. We also respond to environmental conditions, including costs and crises. Our trading agent is first trained for a specific time period and tested on new data and compared with the long-and-hold strategy as a benchmark (market). We analyze the differences between the various models and the in-sample/out-of-sample performance with respect to the environment. The experimental results show that the trading agent follows an appropriate behavior. It can adjust its policy to different circumstances, such as more extensive use of the neutral position when trading costs are present. Furthermore, the net asset value exceeded that of the benchmark, and the agent outperformed the market in the test set. We provide initial insights into the behavior of an agent in a financial domain using a DDQN algorithm. The results of this study can be used for further development.</details> |

This survey paper aims to review the recent developments and use of RL approaches in finance. We give an introduction to Markov decision processes, which is the setting for many of the commonly used RL approaches.

Connections are made with neural networks to extend the framework to encompass deep RL algorithms. Our survey concludes by discussing the application of these RL algorithms in a variety of decision-making problems in finance, including optimal execution, portfolio optimization, option pricing and hedging, market making, smart order routing, and robo-advising.</details> |

Most classical statistical models may have certain limitations when applied to practical scenarios in fields such as energy, healthcare, traffic, meteorology, and economics, especially when high accuracy is required. With the continuous development of deep learning, numerous new models have emerged in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. However, existing surveys have not provided a unified summary of the wide range of model architectures in this field, nor have they given detailed summaries of works in feature extraction and datasets. To address this gap, in this review, we comprehensively study the previous works and summarize the general paradigms of Deep Time Series Forecasting (DTSF) in terms of model architectures. Besides, we take an innovative approach by focusing on the composition of time series and systematically explain important feature extraction methods. Additionally, we provide an overall compilation of datasets from various domains in existing works. Finally, we systematically emphasize the significant challenges faced and future research directions in this field.</details> |

Transformer effectively combines information from the past input and output samples in auto-regressive manner so that each sample becomes aware of all inputs and outputs. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling, the transformer processed samples become effective in predicting the next output. Time series forecasting is a Seq2Seq problem. The original architecture is defined for discrete input and output sequence tokens, but to adopt it for time series, the model must be adapted for continuous data. This work introduces minimal adaptations to make the original transformer architecture suitable for continuous value time series data.</details> |

Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</details> |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</details> |

A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic patterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on network architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies. Inspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series predictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different frequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method based on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through spectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral components and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series. Unlike signal decomposition, which represents the original series as a linear combination of basis signals, our method uses a transformer model to compute cross-attention between the original series and reference series, capturing essential features for forecasting. Experiments on major open and synthetic datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by focusing on attention with a small number of reference series rather than pairwise variable attention, our method ensures scalability and broad applicability.

However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</details> |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</details> |

However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</details> |

Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</details> |
| 2025-03-08 | A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM | Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu et.al. | [2503.06216](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06216) |  | 23 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</details> |

The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</details> |

However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

Wells et.al. | [2503.04956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04956) |  | 40 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper we propose a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem where the loss of a classification decision is only observed at a future time point after the classification decision has to be made. To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</details> |

However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets.   With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging.   Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.   Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</details> |

Over a collection of unseen datasets across diverse domains and forecasting horizons, our empirical evaluations suggest that TimeFound can achieve superior or competitive zero-shot forecasting performance, compared to state-of-the-art time series foundation models.</details> |

The challenge intensifies when anomalies are sparse and the data are multivariate with relational dependencies across sensors or nodes. Traditional univariate anomaly detectors struggle to capture such cross-node dependencies, particularly in sparse anomaly settings. To address this, we propose a graph-augmented time series forecasting approach that explicitly integrates the graph of relationships among time series into an LSTM forecasting model. This enables the model to detect rare anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed in purely univariate approaches. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark datasets - the Yahoo Webscope S5 anomaly dataset and the METR-LA traffic sensor network - and compare the performance of the Graph-Augmented LSTM against LSTM-only, ARIMA, and Prophet baselines. Results demonstrate that the graph-augmented model achieves significantly higher precision and recall, improving F1-score by up to 10% over the best baseline</details> |

Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.

Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</details> |

Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</details> |

To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization.

A validated numerical model is used to study the impact of particle seeding fluctuations on flame stability. Simulations are conducted for the Bunsen setup in the right-side up and up-side down configuration. No significant differences in flame response are identified in flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations. We find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in particle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any intrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust flames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to the lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat release rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven, gaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because the combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion, which is insensitive to temperature.</details> |

It is proved that under the local Lipschitz and some additional assumptions, the ST method with $\theta\in[1/2,1]$ is strongly convergent. It is also obtained that, for all positive stepsizes, the ST method with $\theta\in[1/2,1]$ is asymptotically mean square stable under a coercivity condition.

The complex geometric domain is divided by a uniform Cartesian grid, resulting in challenge in boundary treatment. The proposed ILW boundary treatment could provide high order approximations of both solution values and spatial derivatives at ghost points outside the computational domain. Distinct from existing ILW approaches, our boundary treatment constructs the extrapolation via optimized through a least squares formulation, coupled with the spatial derivatives at the boundary obtained via the ILW procedure. Theoretical analysis indicates that compared with other ILW methods, our proposed one would require fewer terms by using the relatively complicated ILW procedure and thus improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy and stability. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated through numerical experiments.</details> |

The linear systems arising from the filter embedded in the subspace iteration framework, are solved via a preconditioned Krylov method.   The choice of the poles of the filter is based on two criteria. On the one hand, the filter should enhance the eigenvalues in the interval of interest, which suggests that the poles should be chosen close to or in the interval. On the other hand, the choice of poles has an important impact on the convergence speed of the iterative method. For the solution of problems arising from vibrations, the two criteria contradict each other, since fast convergence of the eigensolver requires poles to be in or close to the interval, whereas the iterative linear system solver becomes cheaper when the poles lie further away from the eigenvalues. In the paper, we propose a selection of poles inspired by the shifted Laplace preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation.   We show numerical experiments from finite element models of vibrations. We compare the shifted Laplace rational filter with rational filters based on quadrature rules for contour integration.</details> |

Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off between minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material amount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex problem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour, creating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality. However, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address manufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts) generated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.   A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue. Additionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be strategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated compliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom (volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies for the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of evolving topological families with distinct features.   The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the volume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double Distance Neural Network (D $^2$ NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps worth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs. This proposal offers a novel topology optimization design space based on minimum strut thickness - via filtering - and topological families defined by minimum volume fraction and compliance. The methodology is tested on several examples with diverse loading and boundary conditions, obtaining similarly satisfactory results, and then boosted via Machine Learning, acting as a fast and cheap surrogate.</details> |

These equations are a generalisation of the classic Volterra integral equations, which were first introduced by Vito Volterra in the late 19th century. The loaded Volterra integral equations are characterised by the presence of a load which complicates the process of their theoretical and numerical study. Sometimes these equation are called the equations with ``frozen'' argument. The present work is devoted to the study of Volterra equations with locally loaded integral operators. The existence and uniquness theorems are proved. Among the main contributions is the collocation method for approximate solution of such equations based on the piecewise linear approximation. To confirm the convergence of the method, a number of numerical results for solving model problems are provided.</details> |

However, precise control over Si diffusion remains a critical challenge for high-performance device applications. This study investigates Si diffusion mechanisms in bulk GaN using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by ultra-high-pressure annealing (UHPA) experiments. Vacancy-mediated diffusion pathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs) and activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic direction, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest barrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly improbable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and ring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ( $>$ 12 eV). Phonon calculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion barriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on Si-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450{\deg}C, 1 GPa) confirms negligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions. These findings resolve inconsistencies in prior reports and establish that Si-doped GaN remains highly stable, ensuring reliable doping profiles for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.</details> |

We give two stochastic algorithms for which we prove the almost sure convergence to the operator norm. The algorithm is a random search method for a generalization of the Rayleigh quotient and uses optimal step sizes. Additionally, a convergence analysis is done for the corresponding singular vector and the respective eigenvalue equation.</details> |

Exponential decay of the Fourier coefficients of the system dynamics is key to guarantee convergence. The paper also analyzes a subharmonic formulation that improves the convergence rate. Two numerical examples, including a Duffing oscillator, illustrate the theoretical findings.</details> |

Instead of using a traditional offline/online splitting approach for model order reduction, we adopt an active learning or enrichment strategy to construct a multi-fidelity hierarchy of reduced order models on-the-fly during the outer optimization loop. The multi-fidelity surrogate model consists of a full order model, a reduced order model and a machine learning model. The proposed hierarchical framework adaptively updates its hierarchy when querying parameters, utilizing a rigorous a posteriori error estimator in an error aware trust region framework. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</details> |

Wang et.al. | [2503.21234](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21234) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper focuses on continuous data assimilation (CDA) for the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions. CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem of missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.</details> |

Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.</details> |

The first uses a combined kernel and neural network representation of UCCSD(T) reference data whereas the second is a corrected PES (cR-PES) that eliminates an artificial barrier in the entrance channel appearing in its initial expansion based on full configuration interaction reference data. Despite the differences between the two PESs, both yield $k_{v=0,j=0} \approx 2 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s at $T = 10$ K which is consistent with a $T-$independent Langevin rate $k_{\rm L} = 2.1 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s but considerably larger than the only experimentally reported value $k_{\rm ICR} = (9.1 \pm 2.5) \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s from ion cyclotron resonance experiments. Similarly, branching ratios for the reaction outcomes are comparable for the two PESs. However, when analysing less averaged properties such as initial state-selected $T-$dependent rate coefficients and final vibrational states of the H$_2^+$ product for low temperatures, the differences in the two PESs manifest themselves in the observables. Thus, depending on the property analyzed, accurate and globally valid representations of the PES are required, whereas more approximate and empirical construction schemes can be followed for state-averaged observables.</details> |

Mathematically, it can be formulated as an optimization problem, which is exactly the optimal transportation problem (OT) when the target is in the far field. The gradient of OT is governed by the generalized Monge-Amp`ere equation that models the far-field reflector system. Based on the gradient, this work presents a Sobolev gradient descent method implemented within a finite element framework to solve the corresponding OT. Convergence of the method is established and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</details> |

Negre et.al. | [2503.21176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21176) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>With recent advancements in machine learning for interatomic potentials, Python has become the go-to programming language for exploring new ideas. While machine-learning potentials are often developed in Python-based frameworks, existing molecular dynamics software is predominantly written in lower-level languages. This disparity complicates the integration of machine learning potentials into these molecular dynamics libraries. Additionally, machine learning potentials typically focus on local features, often neglecting long-range electrostatics due to computational complexities. This is a key limitation as applications can require long-range electrostatics and even flexible charges to achieve the desired accuracy. Recent charge equilibration models can address these issues, but they require iterative solvers to assign relaxed flexible charges to the atoms. Conventional implementations also demand very tight convergence to achieve long-term stability, further increasing computational cost. In this work, we present a scalable Python implementation of a recently proposed shadow molecular dynamics scheme based on a charge equilibration model, which avoids the convergence problem while maintaining long-term energy stability and accuracy of observable properties. To deliver a functional and user-friendly Python-based library, we implemented an efficient neighbor list algorithm, Particle Mesh Ewald, and traditional Ewald summation techniques, leveraging the GPU-accelerated power of Triton and PyTorch. We integrated these approaches with the Python-based shadow molecular dynamics scheme, enabling fast charge equilibration for scalable machine learning potentials involving systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms.</details> |

Pryce et.al. | [2503.21078](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21078) |  | 25 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem $\dot x = f(t,x)$, $x(t_0) = x_0$, computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable step size.   A standard ODE method (e.g. Runge-Kutta) treats function $f$ as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires $f$ to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS.   The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger step sizes.   For a standard function, such as $\exp$, this means evaluating $v(t)=\exp(u(t))$, where $u(t),v(t)$ are TS.   The sub-ODE method applies the ODE $d v/d u=v$, obeyed by $v=\exp(u)$, to in-line this operation as $\dot v=v\dot u$.   This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the "Taylor library" with a few lines of code--not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach.   Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients.   We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into $f$ , this approach guarantees a sound system.   We introduce our sub-ODE-based Matlab ODE solver and show that its performance compares favorably with solvers from the Matlab ODE suite.</details> |

Bolhuis, Roberto Covino et.al. | [2503.21037](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21037) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.</details> |

When entire ground and excited potential energy surfaces (PESs) are desired, e.g., to predict the interaction of light excitation and structural changes, one is often forced to use cheaper computational methods at the cost of reduced accuracy. Here we introduce a novel method for the geometrically transferable optimization of neural network wave functions that leverages weight sharing and dynamical ordering of electronic states. Our method enables the efficient prediction of ground and excited-state PESs and their intersections at the highest accuracy, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude cost reduction compared to single-point calculations. We validate our approach on three challenging excited-state PESs, including ethylene, the carbon dimer, and the methylenimmonium cation, indicating that transferable deep-learning QMC can pave the way towards highly accurate simulation of excited-state dynamics.</details> |

However, these systems often exhibit complex surface reconstructions and polymorphism, with properties influenced by kinetic processes and dynamic behavior. A lack of accurate and scalable simulation tools has limited computational modeling of surfaces and interfaces. Recently, machine learning and data-driven methods have expanded the capabilities of theoretical modeling, enabling, for example, the routine use of machine-learned interatomic potentials to predict energies and forces across numerous structures. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, including the scarcity of large, consistent datasets and the need for computational and data-efficient machine learning methods. Additionally, a major challenge lies in the lack of accurate reference data and electronic structure methods for interfaces. Density Functional Theory, while effective for bulk materials, is less reliable for surfaces, and too few accurate experimental studies on interface structure and stability exist. Here, we will sketch the current state of data-driven methods and machine learning in computational surface science and provide a perspective on how these methods will shape the field in the future.</details> |

However, such methods have traditionally been applied to static, deterministic loading, in which modulus, position and direction are known and invariant. This is against the probabilistic load combination used in the structural engineering designs, and entails two important shortcomings.   The first one is related to maintenance and reliability: static loading fails to consider naturally occurring uncertainties in the loading process, measurements or regular service; also ignoring (quantitatively) unforeseen phenomena such as vibrations, and the material's behavior is assumed linear isotropic, ignoring fatigue, plasticity and anisotropy in functionally-graded materials. The second one concerns optimality itself: often times, the structure presented as "optimal" in fact over-estimates loading and thus wastes material by exceeding its real needs and/or distributing it poorly throughout the design dominion.   In this article, a probabilistic framework is presented: uncertain and pseudo-dynamic loading is introduced to create robust topologies via a reinforced SIMP scheme with embedded penalization addressing fatigue damage, layer direction, mechanical response (traction/compression) and yield limit (von Mises equivalent stress). This computationally efficient framework is applied to various loading scenarios, generating diverse designs for the same volume fraction constraint with improved and more realistic performances. Under the proposed method, if loads are permanent and damage isotropic, the methodology converges to the traditional (deterministic) topological optimization results. Future ramifications of this work are pondered, especially regarding metamaterial design.</details> |

We confirm this relationship numerically for some time-delayed reservoirs using simulations, including when the reservoir can be linearized but is actually nonlinear. Finally, we use these closed-form formulae to address the utility of multiple time delays in linear reservoirs in order to perform memory and prediction, finding similar results to previous work on nonlinear reservoirs. We hope these closed-form formulae can be used to understand memory and predictive capabilities in time-delayed reservoirs.</details> |

Defeaturing consists in removing features from complex domains in order to ease the meshing process, and to reduce the computational burden of simulations. It is a common procedure, for example, in computer aided design for simulation based manufacturing. However, depending on the problem at hand, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the solution may be detrimental. The proposed adaptive strategy is hence twofold: starting from a defeatured geometry it allows both for standard mesh refinement and geometrical refinement, which consists in choosing, at each step, which features need to be included into the geometry in order to significantly increase the accuracy of the solution. With respect to other estimators that were previously proposed in the context of defeaturing, the use of an equilibrated flux reconstruction allows us to avoid the evaluation of the numerical flux on the boundary of features. This makes the estimator and the adaptive strategy particularly well-suited for finite element discretizations, in which the numerical flux is typically discontinuous across element edges. The inclusion of the features during the adaptive process is tackled by a CutFEM strategy, in order to preserve the non conformity of the mesh to the feature boundary and never remesh the computational domain as the features are added. Hence, the estimator also accounts for the error introduced by weakly imposing the boundary conditions on the boundary of the added features.</details> |

In this work, we present the methodology for calculation of carrier relaxation times and electrical transport properties without the use of a predefined grid. The relaxation times are evaluated by integrating out the delta function that ensures energy conservation and performing an average over the angular components of phonon momentum. The charge carrier mobility is then evaluated as a sum over appropriately sampled electronic momenta. We illustrate our methodology by applying to the Fr{\"o}hlich model and to a real semiconducting material ZnTe. We find that rather accurate results can be obtained with a modest number of electron and phonon momenta, on the order of one hundred each, regardless of the carrier effective mass.</details> |

Here, we analyzed SNs of $33$ Indian cities to explore how the spatial embedding and the planarity jointly shape their topology. Overall, we found that all the studied SNs have small-world properties with higher clustering and efficiency. The efficiency of the empirical networks is even higher than that of the corresponding degree of preserved random networks. This increased efficiency can be explained by Dijkstra's path-length distribution, which closely fits a right-skewed normal or log-normal distribution. Moreover, we observed that the connectivity of the streets is length-dependent: the smaller streets connect preferably to the smaller streets, while longer streets tend to connect with the longer counterparts. This length-dependent connectivity is more profound in the empirical SNs than in the corresponding degree preserved random and random planar networks. However, planar networks maintaining the empirical spatial coordinates replicate the connectivity behavior of empirical SNs, highlighting the influence of spatial embedding. Moreover, the robustness of the cities in terms of resilience to random errors and targeted attacks is independent of the SN's size, indicating other factors, such as geographical constraints, substantially influence network stability.</details> |

Unlike the residual type error estimators, one can not establish upper and lower a posteriori error bounds for the classical recovery type error estimators without the saturation assumption. In this paper, we first present three examples to show the unsatisfactory performance in the practice of standard residual or recovery-type error estimators, then, an improved gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator is constructed. The proposed error estimator contains two parts, one is the difference between the direct and post-processed gradient approximations, and the other is the residual of the recovered gradient. The reliability and efficiency of the enhanced estimator are derived. Based on the improved recovery-based error estimator and the newest-vertex bisection refinement method with a tailored mark strategy, an adaptive finite element algorithm is designed. We then prove the convergence of the adaptive method by establishing the contraction of gradient error plus oscillation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the asymptotic exactness of the new recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and the high efficiency of the corresponding adaptive algorithm.</details> |

A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</details> |

CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.</details> |

A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</details> |

This study explores the use of Optimization by Prompting, an iterative approach utilizing large language models (LLMs), to address these challenges. The method is straightforward to implement, requiring no hyperparameter tuning or complex mathematical formulations. Optimization problems can be described in plain English, with only an evaluator and a parsing script needed for execution. The in-context learning capabilities of LLMs enable them to understand problem nuances, therefore, they have the potential to surpass traditional metaheuristic optimization methods. This study demonstrates the application of LLMs as optimizers to Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel lattice design, showing the capability of commercial LLMs to achieve superior optimization results compared to traditional methods.</details> |

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, $h$-$p$ adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.</details> |

However, the computational costs of this so-called FE $^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.   The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.</details> |

This work has been accepted for publication in Numerical   Methods for Partial Differential Equations | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a kernel compensation method for Maxwell eigenproblem for photonic crystals to avoid the infinite-dimensional kernels that cause many difficulties in the calculation of energy gaps. The quasi-periodic problem is first transformed into a periodic one on the cube by the Floquet-Bloch theory. Then the compensation operator is introduced in Maxwell's equation with the shifted curl operator. The discrete problem depends on the compatible discretization of the de Rham complex, which is implemented by the mimetic finite difference method in this paper. We prove that the compensation term exactly fills up the kernel of the original problem and avoids spurious eigenvalues. Also, we propose an efficient preconditioner and its FFT and multigrid solvers, which allow parallel computing. Numerical experiments for different three-dimensional lattices are performed to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the method.</details> |

Approximating such solutions in the stochastic setting is particularly challenging due to randomized frequency interactions and presents a compelling challenge for the construction of tailored schemes. In particular, we design the first resonance-based schemes for this equation, which achieve provable convergence for solutions of much lower regularity than previously required. A crucial ingredient in this construction is the Wong--Zakai approximation of stochastic dispersive system, which introduces piecewise linear phases that capture nonlinear frequency interactions and can subsequently be approximated to construct resonance-based schemes. We prove the well-posedness of the Wong--Zakai approximated equation and establish its proximity to the original full stochastic dispersive system. Based on this approximation, we demonstrate an improved strong convergence rate for our new scheme, which exploits the stochastic nature of the dispersive terms. Finally, we provide numerical experiments underlining the favourable performance of our novel method in practice.</details> |

Howard et.al. | [2503.19333](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19333) |  | 27 pages, 13 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise as a framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress in the field, it remains challenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While approaches such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the \emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to B-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more efficient. This observation, combined with E-PINNs' more consistent uncertainty estimates and better calibration compared to Dropout-PINNs for the examples presented, indicates that E-PINNs offer a promising approach in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</details> |

In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger "Prony-Ritz equivalence class", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.</details> |

While current REV-scale models are able to reproduce the main features of laboratory experiments, they neglect effects like the formation of preferential flow paths and the appearance of multiple polymorphs of calcium carbonate with differing properties. We show that extending an existing EICP model by the conceptual assumption of a mobile precipitate, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), allows for the formation of preferential flow paths when the initial porosity is heterogeneous. We apply sensitivity analysis and Bayesian inference to gain an understanding of the influence of characteristic parameters of ACC that are uncertain or unknown and compare two variations of the model based on different formulations of the ACC detachment term to analyse the plausibility of our hypothesis. An arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) surrogate model is trained based on the full model and used to reduce the computational cost of this study.</details> |

However, HPC users are generally less aware of how these energy concerns influence the design, deployment, and operation of supercomputers even though they experience the consequences. This paper examines the implications of HPC's energy consumption, providing an overview of current trends aimed at improving energy efficiency. We describe how hardware innovations such as energy-efficient processors, novel system architectures, power management techniques, and advanced scheduling policies do have a direct impact on how applications need to be programmed and executed on HPC systems. For application developers, understanding how these new systems work and how to analyse and report the performances of their own software is critical in the dialog with HPC system designers and administrators. The paper aims to raise awareness about energy efficiency among users, particularly in the high energy physics and astrophysics domains, offering practical advice on how to analyse and optimise applications to reduce their energy consumption without compromising on performance.</details> |

We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</details> |

Although the theory for adaptive finite element methods based on residual-type a posteriori error estimator and bisection refinement has been well established, in practical computations, the use of non-asymptotic exact of error estimator and the excessive number of adaptive iteration steps often lead to inefficiency of the adaptive algorithm. We propose an efficient adaptive finite element method based on high-accuracy techniques including the superconvergence recovery technique and high-quality mesh optimization. The centroidal Voronoi Delaunay triangulation mesh optimization is embedded in the mesh adaption to provide high-quality mesh, and then assure that the superconvergence property of the recovered gradient and the asymptotical exactness of the error estimator. A tailored adaptive strategy, which could generate high-quality meshes with a target number of vertices, is developed to ensure the adaptive computation process terminated within $7$ steps. The effectiveness and robustness of the adaptive algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</details> |

In the Eulerian description fluid flow modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains in Eulerian coordinates, while elastic solids are transformed from Lagrangian coordinates into the Eulerian system. A monolithic description is adopted. For the spatial discretization, we employ an unfitted finite element method with ghost penalties based on inf-sup stable finite elements. To handle contact, we use a relaxation of the contact condition in combination with a unified Nitsche approach that takes care implicitly of the switch between fluid-structure interaction and contact conditions. The temporal discretization is based on a backward Euler scheme with implicit extensions of solutions at the previous time step. The nonlinear system is solved with a semi-smooth Newton's method with line search. Our formulation, discretization and implementation are substantiated with an elastic falling ball that comes into contact with the bottom boundary, constituting a challenging state-of-the-art benchmark.</details> |

We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous single vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal single vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications.

Previously, isothermal macroscale models have been derived to describe this material injection and the mechanical interactions which arise. However, the temperature of the injected cement is typically below the human body temperature, necessitating the extension of these models to the non-isothermal case. Following the modelling principles of the TPM and considering local thermal non-equilibrium conditions, our model introduces three energy balances as well as additional constitutive relations. If restricted to local thermal equilibrium conditions, our model equations are in agreement with other examples of TPM-based models. We observe that our model elicits physically reasonable behaviour in numerical simulations which employ parameter values and initial and boundary conditions relevant for our application. Noting that we neglect capillary effects, we claim our model to be thermodynamically consistent despite the employment of simplifying assumptions during its derivation, such as the Coleman and Noll procedure.</details> |

Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.</details> |

The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of hybridization techniques to both the pressure and concentration equations. Additionally, an upwind scheme is utilized to address convection-dominant scenarios, and a ``cut-off" operator is introduced to maintain the boundedness of porosity. Compared to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, the proposed approach results in a global system with fewer unknowns and sparser stencils, thereby significantly reducing computational costs.

Property-directed generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these limitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1 (translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents a significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.</details> |

A key feature of this model is that reactions between different species occur only at the interface, and may induce deformation of the interface. For the governing equations derived based on the energy variational method, we propose a structure-preserving numerical scheme that satisfies the mass conservation and energy dissipation laws at the discrete level. Furthermore, we carry out a rigorous error analysis of the time-discrete scheme for a simplified case. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the model as well as the accuracy and stability of the scheme. In particular, we simulate microvessels with straight and bifurcated structures to illustrate the risk of microaneurysm formation.</details> |

Suggestions and comments are welcome | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>One of the mechanisms responsible for disk formation around the black holes is Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion.The fact that BHL accretion can be interrupted by various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar winds or astrophysical jets, makes it crucial to study the behavior of shock cones formed by BHL accretion around black holes once the accretion process is halted. Investigating the new plasma structures that emerge in these scenarios can provide insights into observational results. In this context, a new plasma structure forming around the Kerr black hole has been numerically modeled as a function of the black hole spin parameter and the asymptotic velocity of BHL accretion. The numerical analysis revealed that high spin (a/M=0.9) and supersonic flow ( M > 1) are necessary conditions for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) formation. On the other hand, the fundamental mode of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) are found to be independent of both the black hole spin and asymptotic velocity and are instead governed by general relativistic effects. Additionally, the study demonstrated that for 3:2 and 2:1 resonance states to form, nonlinear couplings needs to be occurred when the black hole rotates rapidly. These couplings produce harmonic frequencies, providing an explanation for the observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) resonances in black hole binaries. These findings align with precession models and nonlinear resonance models, both of which play a crucial role in QPO generation. Finally, the LFQPOs and HFQPOs obtained from numerical simulations are consistent with the observed QPO frequencies in the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564, as well as in the AGN REJ1034+396, which harbors a supermassive black hole at its center.</details> |

Mora, Kirsten Morris et.al. | [2503.16388](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16388) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this manuscript, we present a mixed finite element discretization for a class of boundary-damped anisotropic port-Hamiltonian systems. Using a multiplier method, we demonstrate that the resulting approximation model uniformly preserves the exponential stability of the uncontrolled system, establishing a lower bound for the exponential decay rate that is independent of the mesh size. This property is illustrated through the spatial discretization of a piezoelectric beam. Furthermore, we show how the uniform preservation of exponential stability by the proposed model aids in the convergence of controllers derived from an infinite-time linear quadratic control design, in comparison to models obtained from the standard finite-element method.</details> |

Altschuler, Jelena Diakonikolas et.al. | [2503.16312](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16312) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In 1960, Osborne proposed a simple iterative algorithm for matrix balancing with outstanding numerical performance. Today, it is the default preconditioning procedure before eigenvalue computation and other linear algebra subroutines in mainstream software packages such as Python, Julia, MATLAB, EISPACK, LAPACK, and more. Despite its widespread usage, Osborne's algorithm has long resisted theoretical guarantees for its runtime: the first polynomial-time guarantees were obtained only in the past decade, and recent near-linear runtimes remain confined to variants of Osborne's algorithm with important differences that make them simpler to analyze but empirically slower. In this paper, we address this longstanding gap between theory and practice by proving that Osborne's original algorithm -- the de facto preconditioner in practice -- in fact has a near-linear runtime. This runtime guarantee (1) is optimal in the input size up to at most a single logarithm, (2) is the first runtime for Osborne's algorithm that does not dominate the runtime of downstream tasks like eigenvalue computation, and (3) improves upon the theoretical runtimes for all other variants of Osborne's algorithm.</details> |

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | On the convergence of split exponential integrators for semilinear parabolic problems | Marco Caliari, Fabio Cassini, Lukas Einkemmer et.al. | [2503.16210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16210) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Splitting the exponential-like $\varphi$ functions, which typically appear in exponential integrators, is attractive in many situations since it can dramatically reduce the computational cost of the procedure. However, depending on the employed splitting, this can result in order reduction. The aim of this paper is to analyze different such split approximations. We perform the analysis for semilinear problems in the abstract framework of commuting semigroups and derive error bounds that depend, in particular, on whether the vector (to which the $\varphi$ functions are applied) satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. We then present the convergence analysis for two split versions of a second-order exponential Runge--Kutta integrator in the context of analytic semigroups, and show that one suffers from order reduction while the other does not. Numerical results for semidiscretized parabolic PDEs confirm the theoretical findings.</details> |

In the first part of the paper we prove that square root Lasso $({\tt rLasso})$ with a particular choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda>0$ as well as orthogonal matching pursuit $({\tt OMP})$ after sufficiently many iterations provide noise blind decoders which efficiently recover multivariate functions from random samples. In contrast to basis pursuit the decoders $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ do not require any additional information on the width of the function class in $L_\infty$ and lead to instance optimal recovery guarantees. In the second part of the paper we relate the findings to linear recovery methods such as least squares $({\tt Lsqr})$ or Smolyak's algorithm $({\tt Smolyak})$ and compare the performance in a model situation, namely periodic multivariate functions with $L_p$-bounded mixed derivative will be approximated in $L_q$. The main observation is the fact, that $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ outperform Smolyak's algorithm (sparse grids) in various situations, where $1<p<2\leq q<\infty$. For $q=2$ they even outperform any linear method including $({\tt Lsqr})$ in combination with recently proposed subsampled random points.</details> |

In GASS, the deployment of AVs is crucial to ensure overall performance from GUs to satellites. This paper develops a stochastic geometry-based analytical model for GASS under Matern hard-core point process (MHCPP) distributed AVs. The 3D distributions of AVs and GUs are modeled by considering their locations on spherical surfaces in the presence of high-altitude satellites. Accordingly, we derive an overall connectivity analytical model for GASS, which includes the average performance of AV-relayed two-hop transmissions. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of the connectivity model and provide essential insights for configuring AV deployments.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | An interior penalty DG method with correct and minimal averages, jumps and penalties for the miscible displacement problem of nonnegative characteristic form, and SUPG-type error estimates under low regularity, dominating Darcy velocity | Zhijie Du, Huoyuan Duan, Roger C E Tan et.al. | [2503.16196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16196) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>An interior penalty DG method is proposed for the steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form, suitable for mixed second-order elliptic-parabolic and first-order hyperbolic equations. Due to the different natures of the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. In the new DG method, the averages, jumps and penalties are minimal, correctly and only imposed on the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries, in addition to the well-known upwind jumps associating with the advection velocity. For the advection-dominated problem, the penalties can be further reduced only being imposed on the diffusion-dominated subset of the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries.This is based on the novel, crucial technique about the multiple partitions of the set of the interelement boundaries into a number of subsets with respect to the diffusion and to the advection and on the consistency result we have proven. The new DG method is the first DG method and the first time that the continuity and discontinuity of the solution are correctly identified and justified of the general steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form. The new DG method and its analysis are applied to the miscible displacement problem of vanishing diffusion coefficient and of low regularity, dominating Darcy flow velocity which lives in $H(\operatorname{div};\Omega)\cap \prod_{j=1}^J (H^r(D_j))^d$ for $r<1$ other than the usual assumption $(W^{1,\infty}(\Omega))^d$. We prove the SUPG-type error estimates $\mathcal{O}(h^{\ell+\frac{1}{2}})$ for any element polynomial of degree $\ell\ge 1$ on generally shaped and nonconforming meshes, where the convergence order is independent of the regularity of the advection velocity. The SUPG-type error estimates obtained are new and the first time known under the low regularity of the advection velocity.</details> |

If furthermore that pair of M-eigenvectors is positive, then that M$^+$-eigenvalue is called an M$^{++}$-eigenvalue. A nonnegative biquadratic tensor always has at least one M$^+$ eigenvalue, and the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue is also the largest M-eigenvalue and the M-spectral radius. In the case of an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, all the M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Although the M$^+$-eigenvalues of irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors are not unique in general, we establish a sufficient condition to ensure their uniqueness. For an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a max-min characterization, while the smallest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a min-max characterization. A Collatz algorithm for computing the largest M$^+$ -eigenvalues is proposed. Numerical results are reported.</details> |

We compute the spin-dependent cross section within collinear twist-3 factorization in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In this approach, multiparton correlations generate a non-vanishing effect. For the present paper, we focus on correlations in the nucleon initial-state rather than in the fragmentation process. We explicitly verify that collinear twist-3 factorization is valid at the one-loop level. Our analytical results show that at NLO the relevant multiparton correlation functions in the nucleon are probed on their full support in momentum fractions. Our numerical analysis for collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider indicates that the NLO corrections can be large and are sensitive to the functional form of the twist-3 correlation functions.</details> |

We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range.   Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.</details> |

Vortices, characterized by circular in-plane magnetization (chirality) and out-of-plane core polarization, naturally arise in confined geometries due to the interplay between exchange and dipolar interactions. In contrast, skyrmions typically require the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for stabilization and exhibit fixed chirality-polarity relationships. Through micromagnetic simulations, we reveal that these seemingly distinct topological states can coexist, forming a novel composite state termed the \textit{n}-skyrmion vortex, which represents a skyrmion-embedded vortex state. These composite states possess quantized topological charges $Q$ that follow the relation $Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{vortex}} + nQ_{\text{skyrmion}}$, where $n$ denotes the number of embedded skyrmions. Similar to vortices, these states exhibit independent chirality and polarity and are energetically degenerate.</details> |

It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$ . It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</details> |

In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</details> |

As an example, we consider situations where noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of optimal scalar regularisation.</details> |

The implementation of the package is PDE agnostic, meaning that the same code can be used to solve a wide range of equations, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady and unsteady problems. We highlight the main innovations of ROManifolds, we detail its implementation principles, we introduce its building blocks by providing usage examples, and we solve a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3d geometry.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory for Periodic Solids: Construction of the Pauli Potential | Sangita Majumdar, Zekun Shi, Giovanni Vignale et.al. | [2503.15959](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15959) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The practical success of density functional theory (DFT) is largely credited to the Kohn-Sham approach, which enables the exact calculation of the non-interacting electron kinetic energy via an auxiliary noninteracting system. Yet, the realization of DFT's full potential awaits the discovery of a direct link between the electron density, $n$, and the non-interacting kinetic energy, $T_{S}[n]$. In this work, we address two key challenges towards this objective. First, we introduce a new algorithm for directly solving the constrained minimization problem yielding $T_{S}[n]$ for periodic densities -- a class of densities that, in spite of its central importance for materials science, has received limited attention in the literature. Second, we present a numerical procedure that allows us to calculate the functional derivative of $T_{S}[n]$ with respect to the density at constant electron number, also known as the Kohn-Sham potential $V_{S}[n](\rv)$. Lastly, the algorithm is augmented with a subroutine that computes the ``derivative discontinuity", i.e., the spatially uniform jump in $V_{S}[n](\rv)$ which occurs upon increasing or decreasing the total number of electrons. This feature allows us to distinguish between ``insulating" and ``conducting" densities for non interacting electrons. The code integrates key methodological innovations, such as the use of an adaptive basis set (``equidensity orbitals") for wave function expansion and the QR decomposition to accelerate the implementation of the orthogonality constraint. Notably, we derive a closed-form expression for the Pauli potential in one dimension, expressed solely in terms of the input density, without relying on Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We validate this method on one-dimensional periodic densities, achieving results within ``chemical accuracy".</details> |

Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.</details> |

This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\"atze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</details> |

However, most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866 defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT) relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool for defect-focused materials research.</details> |

Kasilov et.al. | [2503.15278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</details> |

As an example, we derive structured generalizations of the HSS (Hermitian/skew-Hermitian) iteration, and provide sufficient conditions for their convergence.</details> |

However, the high computational cost of MBD calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.</details> |

However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</details> |
| 2025-03-19 | Efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems based on dimension reduction and Kriging surrogate modeling in functional space | Zhouzhou Song, Weiyun Xu, Marcos A. Valdebenito et.al. | [2503.15077](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15077) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Surrogate models are extensively employed for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in complex, computation-intensive engineering problems. Nonetheless, constructing high-accuracy surrogate models for complex dynamical systems with limited training samples continues to be a challenge, as capturing the variability in high-dimensional dynamical system responses with a small training set is inherently difficult. This study introduces an efficient Kriging modeling framework based on functional dimension reduction (KFDR) for conducting forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems. By treating the responses of dynamical systems as functions of time, the proposed KFDR method first projects these responses onto a functional space spanned by a set of predefined basis functions, which can deal with noisy data by adding a roughness regularization term. A few key latent functions are then identified by solving the functional eigenequation, mapping the time-variant responses into a low-dimensional latent functional space. Subsequently, Kriging surrogate models with noise terms are constructed in the latent space. With an inverse mapping established from the latent space to the original output space, the proposed approach enables accurate and efficient predictions for dynamical systems. Finally, the surrogate model derived from KFDR is directly utilized for efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification of the dynamical system. Through three numerical examples, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to construct highly accurate surrogate models and perform uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems accurately and efficiently.</details> |

At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\"odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.</details> |

The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate multiphase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phases of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity ($C_{max}$) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.5). The experimental efforts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder, we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ composition with the highest measured value of $C_{max}$. Additionally, several other structures are considered as reference points. We find that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La$_2$Ni$_7$ have almost identical total energies, which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

This method contains three steps: (1) train a PINN and obtain an approximate solution $u_{\theta}$; (2) enrich the finite element space with $u_{\theta}$; (3) obtain the final solution by FEM in the enriched space. In the second step, the enriched space is constructed by addition $v + u_{\theta}$ or multiplication $v \cdot u_{\theta}$, where $v$ belongs to the standard finite element space. We conduct the convergence analysis for the proposed method. Compared to the standard FEM, the same convergence order is obtained and higher accuracy can be achieved when solution derivatives are well approximated in PINN. Numerical examples from one dimension to three dimensions verify these theoretical results. For some examples, the accuracy of the proposed method can be reduced by a couple of orders of magnitude compared to the standard FEM.</details> |

Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone.

As it is well known, SL schemes are not well suited for unstructured grids, due to the cost of the point location phase; this drawback is augmented by the need for repeated minimization. In this work, we propose a scheme that works only on the basis of node values and connectivity of the grid. In a first version, we obtain a monotone scheme; then, applying a quadratic refinement to the numerical solution, we improve accuracy at the price of some extra computational cost. The scheme can be applied to both time-dependent and stationary HJ equations; in the latter case, we also study the construction of a fast policy iteration solver. We perform a theoretical analysis of the two versions, and validate them with an extensive set of examples, both in the time-dependent and in the stationary case.</details> |

The aim is to reconstruct the model parameters from stress data acquired from a relaxation experiment, where the number of Maxwell elements, and thus the number of material parameters themselves, are assumed to be unknown. This implies that the forward operator acts on a Cartesian product of a semigroup (of integers) and a Hilbert space and demands for an extension of existing regularization theory. We develop a stable reconstruction procedure by applying Bayesian inversion to this setting. We use an appropriate binomial prior which takes the integer setting for the number of Maxwell elements into account and at the same time computes the underlying material parameters. We extend the regularization theory for inverse problems to this special setup and prove existence, stability and convergence of the computed solution. The theoretical results are evaluated by extensive numerical tests.</details> |

Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</details> |

Basing upon a reduced and rescaled optimality system, we derive a posteriori bounds capturing the approximation of the state, the adjoint state, the control and the observation. The upper and lower bounds show a gap, which grows with decreasing cost or Tikhonov regularization parameter. This growth is mitigated compared to previous results and can be countered by refinement if control and observation involve compact operators. Numerical results illustrate these properties for model problems with distributed and boundary control.</details> |

In the case of a cubic nonlinearity, we show almost second-order convergence in $L^2$ and almost first-order convergence in $H^1$ . If the nonlinearity has a quartic form instead, we show an analogous convergence result with an order reduced by 1/2. To our knowledge these are the best convergence results available for the 3D cubic and quartic wave equations under the finite-energy condition. Our approach relies on continuous- and discrete-time Strichartz estimates. We also make use of the integration and summation by parts formulas to exploit cancellations in the error terms. Moreover, error bounds for a full discretization using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space are given. Finally, we discuss a numerical example indicating the sharpness of our theoretical results.</details> |

Our approach is based on a convex combination of two numerical flows, both of which are constructed from positivity preserving methods. The strong convergence of the Euler version of the method is proven to be of order $\tfrac{1}{2}$ , and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that, in some cases, first-order convergence is observed in practice. We compare the Euler and Milstein versions of these new methods to existing domain preservation methods in the literature and observe our methods are robust, more widely applicable and that the error constant is in most cases superior.</details> |

However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong short-term forecasting capabilities with time-domain decomposition techniques. Our approach segments the time domain of the dynamical system, independently constructing snapshot matrices and performing localized predictions within each segment. We first introduce a localized DMD method with predefined partitioning, which is simple to implement, and then extend it to an adaptive partitioning strategy that enhances prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for our method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to four benchmark problems: Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that our method significantly improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.</details> |

In this work, a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antenna is considered. The radiator is developed using a bi-stage algorithm that involves min-max classification of randomly-generated topologies followed by local tuning of the promising designs using a trust-region optimization applied to a feature-based representation of the structure frequency response. The automatically generated antenna is characterized by -10 dB bandwidth of over 600 MHz w.r.t. the center frequency of 6.5 GHz and a dual-lobe radiation pattern. The obtained performance figures make the radiator of use for in-door positioning applications.

However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm $^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</details> |

Trust-region (TR) methods coupled with data-efficient surrogates based on finite differentiation (FD) represent a popular class of antenna design algorithms. However, TR performance is subject to FD setup, which is normally determined a priori based on rules-of-thumb. In this work, the effect of FD perturbations on the performance of TR-based design is evaluated on a case study basis concerning a total of 80 optimizations of a planar antenna structure. The obtained results demonstrate that, for the considered radiator, the performance of the final designs obtained using different FD setups may vary by as much as 18 dB (and by over 4 dB on average). At the same time, the a priori perturbations in a range between 1.5% and 3% (w.r.t. the initial design) seem to be suitable for maintaining (relatively) consistent and high-quality results.</details> |

From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</details> |

Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</details> |

Various numerical tools and software packages have been developed with this purpose in mind, typically utilizing the harmonic oscillator basis or the charge basis to represent a Hamiltonian. In this work, we instead consider the use of discrete variable representations (DVRs) to model superconducting circuits. In particular, we use `sinc DVRs' of both charge number and phase to approximate the eigenenergies of several prototypical examples, exploring their use and effectiveness in the numerical analysis of superconducting circuits. We find that not only are these DVRs capable of achieving decoherence-accurate simulation, i.e., accuracy at the resolution of experiments subject to decay, decoherence, and dephasing, they also demonstrate improvements in efficiency with smaller basis sizes and better convergence over standard approaches, showing that DVRs are an advantageous alternative for representing superconducting circuits.</details> |

The resulting scheme is shown to ensure mass and momentum conservation at the discrete level. In addition, a new formulation of the conservative integrator is proposed which facilitates a projector splitting integrator. Numerical experiments validate our approach in one- and two-dimensional simulations of Landau damping. As a demonstration of feasibility, it is also shown that the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator can be combined with mesh adaptivity.</details> |

These immune cells are attracted to the wound after an injury and they move showing both directional and random motion. Thus, first, we smooth the trajectories and we separate the random from the directional parts of the motion. The smoothing model is based on curve evolution where the curve motion is influenced by the smoothing term and the attracting term. Once we obtain the random sub-trajectories, we analyze them using the mean squared displacement to characterize the type of diffusion. Finally, we compute the velocities on the smoothed trajectories and use them as sparse samples to reconstruct the wound attractant field. To do that, we consider a minimization problem for the vector components and lengths, which leads to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet conditions for the sparse samples and zero Neumann boundary conditions on the domain boundary.</details> |

In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$ -factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</details> |

To address the multiscale nature of the sediment distribution, we treat it as an inhomogeneous random field and use the homogenization theory in deriving the effective medium model. The inverse problem is formulated as the reconstruction of the effective medium model, specifically, the sediment concentration, from partial boundary measurements. Additionally, we develop numerical algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of solving this inverse problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods in producing accurate sediment concentration estimates, offering new insights into sediment concentration measurement in complex environments.</details> |

This method intermittently integrates the general synthetic iterative scheme with the shear stress transport turbulence model into the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach, enabling the simulation of gas flows across the free-molecular, transition, slip, and turbulent regimes. First, the macroscopic synthetic equations, derived directly from DSMC, are coupled with the turbulence model to establish a constitutive relation that incorporates not only turbulent and laminar transport coefficients but also higher-order terms accounting for rarefaction effects. Second, the macroscopic properties, statistically sampled over specific time intervals in DSMC, along with the turbulent properties provided by the turbulence model, serve as initial conditions for solving the macroscopic synthetic equations. Finally, the simulation particles in DSMC are updated based on the macroscopic properties obtained from the synthetic equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method asymptotically converges to either the turbulence model or DSMC results, adaptively adjusting to different flow regimes. Then, this coupling method is applied to simulate an opposing jet surrounded by hypersonic rarefied gas flows, revealing significant variations in surface properties due to the interplay of turbulent and rarefied effects. This study presents an efficient methodology for simulating the complex interplay between rarefied and turbulent flows, establishing a foundational framework for investigating the coupled effects of turbulence, hypersonic conditions, and chemical reactions in rarefied gas dynamics in the future.</details> |

The formulation is provided in matrix notation in detail. The use of a director vector, as opposed to multi-parameter shell models, significantly reduces the computational cost by minimizing the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of the spectral element method (SEM) in combination with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature regarding the computational costs to generate the element stiffness matrix. To assess the performance of the new formulation for large deformation analysis, we compare it to three other numerical methods. One of these methods is a non-isoparametric SEM shell using the geometry definition of isogeometric analysis (IGA), while the other two are IGA shell formulations which differ in the rotation interpolation. All formulations base on Rodrigues' rotation tensor. Through the solution of various challenging numerical examples, it is demonstrated that although IGA benefits from an exact geometric representation, its influence on solution accuracy is less significant than that of shape function characteristics and rotational formulations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed SEM shell, despite its simpler rotational formulation, can produce results comparable to the most accurate and complex version of IGA. Finally, we discuss the optimal SEM strategy, emphasizing the effectiveness of employing coarser meshes with higher-order elements.</details> |

| 2025-03-13 | Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Comparative Study of Phase Change Materials and Air-Cooling Systems Equipped with Fins | Masoumeh Karimi Kisomi et.al. | [2503.10244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10244) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Lithium-ion batteries are extensively utilized as the primary power source for electric vehicles due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness and lightweight nature. However, their performance and safety are highly dependent on operating temperature. Therefore, a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential to ensure the reliable operation and safety of electric vehicles. This study presents a battery thermal management system incorporating phase change material (PCM) and air cooling in a cylindrical lithium-ion cell with fins to enhance heat dissipation. The effects of each system on maximum and minimum temperature, and temperature uniformity along the battery cell are analyzed. Additionally, the impact of fins in both systems is evaluated against a finless cell. A numerical analysis utilizing ANSYS software and the finite volume method (FVM) is performed to evaluate the cooling performance of the systems. The results show that PCM reduces both the maximum and minimum temperatures compared to the air cooling system due to the phase change mechanism. In the finless battery case, the maximum temperature decreases from 316 K to 304 K when using PCM instead of the air cooling system. Also, in the same fin-based battery, the minimum temperature decreases from 307 K to 302 K by using PCM instead of the air cooling system, leading to improved temperature stability. The results indicate that, in general, the fins help reduce the maximum cell temperature when compared to the case without fins in both cases. Using rectangular fins reduces the maximum temperature by approximately 3% compared to a finless battery in the air cooling system. Additionally, the presence of fins reduces the temperature difference along the battery, ensuring a more uniform temperature distribution, such that, in the PCM system with rectangular fins, the temperature difference remains below 1 K.</details> |

However, Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation may become unstable when handling data from diverse distributions (e.g., solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)). Additionally, Monte Carlo sampling methods are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions. In the first stage, we introduce a new weighting formulation to ensure the stability of the Bayesian MAP estimation. In the second stage, we derive the necessary condition to efficiently quantify the uncertainty of the solutions, by combining the new weighting formula with variational inference. Furthermore, we establish an error estimation theorem that relates the exact solution to the optimally estimated solution under different amounts of observed data. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.</details> |

Our findings are derived from the application of multilinear estimates established within the framework of discrete Bourgain spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the solution $(E,z,z_t) \in H^{s+r+1/2}\times H^{s+r}\times H^{s+r-1}$, the error in $H^{r+1/2}\times H^{r}\times H^{r-1}$ is $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{s/2})$ for $s\in(0,2]$, where $r=\max(0,\frac d2-1)$ . To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first explicit error estimate for the splitting method based on the original Zakharov system, as well as the first instance where low regularity error estimates for coupled equations have been considered within the Bourgain framework.

Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | Highly efficient norm preserving numerical schemes for micromagnetic energy minimization based on SAV method | Jiajun Zhan, Lei Yang, Jiayun He et.al. | [2503.10179](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10179) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, two efficient and magnetization norm preserving numerical schemes based on the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method are developed for calculating the ground state in micromagnetic structures. The first SAV scheme is based on the original SAV method for the gradient flow model, while the second scheme features an updated scalar auxiliary variable to better align with the associated energy. To address the challenging constraint of pointwise constant magnetization length, an implicit projection method is designed, and verified by both SAV schemes. Both proposed SAV schemes partially preserve energy dissipation and exhibit exceptional efficiency, requiring two linear systems with constant coefficients to be solved. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform during the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our SAV schemes outperform commonly used numerical methods in terms of both efficiency and stability.</details> |

Without the full column rank assumptions on Jacobi matrices of nonlinear systems, we provide a thorough convergence analysis, and derive upper bounds for the convergence rates of the new methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods with momentum are much more effective than the existing ones.</details> |
