| 2025-03-06 | Matrix H-theory approach to stock market fluctuations | Luan M. T. de Moraes, Antônio M. S. Macedo, Raydonal Ospina et.al. | [2503.08697](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08697) |  | 26 pages, 10 figures. Published on Physical Review E | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce matrix H theory, a framework for analyzing collective behavior arising from multivariate stochastic processes with hierarchical structure. The theory models the joint distribution of the multiple variables (the measured signal) as a compound of a large-scale multivariate distribution with the distribution of a slowly fluctuating background. The background is characterized by a hierarchical stochastic evolution of internal degrees of freedom, representing the correlations between stocks at different time scales. As in its univariate version, the matrix H-theory formalism also has two universality classes: Wishart and inverse Wishart, enabling a concise description of both the background and the signal probability distributions in terms of Meijer G-functions with matrix argument. Empirical analysis of daily returns of stocks within the S&P500 demonstrates the effectiveness of matrix H theory in describing fluctuations in stock markets. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multivariate hierarchical processes and offer potential for developing more informed portfolio strategies in financial markets.</details> |
| 2025-03-05 | Multimodal Stock Price Prediction: A Case Study of the Russian Securities Market | Kasymkhan Khubiev, Mikhail Semenov et.al. | [2503.08696](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08696) |  | NSCF-2024, PROGRAM SYSTEMS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Classical asset price forecasting methods primarily rely on numerical data, such as price time series, trading volumes, limit order book data, and technical analysis indicators. However, the news flow plays a significant role in price formation, making the development of multimodal approaches that combine textual and numerical data for improved prediction accuracy highly relevant. This paper addresses the problem of forecasting financial asset prices using the multimodal approach that combines candlestick time series and textual news flow data. A unique dataset was collected for the study, which includes time series for 176 Russian stocks traded on the Moscow Exchange and 79,555 financial news articles in Russian. For processing textual data, pre-trained models RuBERT and Vikhr-Qwen2.5-0.5b-Instruct (a large language model) were used, while time series and vectorized text data were processed using an LSTM recurrent neural network. The experiments compared models based on a single modality (time series only) and two modalities, as well as various methods for aggregating text vector representations. Prediction quality was estimated using two key metrics: Accuracy (direction of price movement prediction: up or down) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which measures the deviation of the predicted price from the true price. The experiments showed that incorporating textual modality reduced the MAPE value by 55%. The resulting multimodal dataset holds value for the further adaptation of language models in the financial sector. Future research directions include optimizing textual modality parameters, such as the time window, sentiment, and chronological order of news messages.</details> |
| 2025-03-02 | Liquidity-adjusted Return and Volatility, and Autoregressive Models | Qi Deng, Zhong-guo Zhou et.al. | [2503.08693](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08693) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely designed liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that incorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we introduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations of traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling illiquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We demonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for cryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and reduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is validated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance (LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.</details> |
| 2025-02-27 | Detecting Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes: A Thresholding-Based Approach to Handling Market Noise | Mahya Karbalaii et.al. | [2503.08692](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08692) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a simple yet robust unsupervised model to detect pump-and-dump events on tokens listed on the Poloniex Exchange platform. By combining threshold-based criteria with exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and volatility measures, our approach effectively distinguishes genuine anomalies from minor trading fluctuations, even for tokens with low liquidity and prolonged inactivity. These characteristics present a unique challenge, as standard anomaly-detection methods often over-flag negligible volume spikes. Our framework overcomes this issue by tailoring both price and volume thresholds to the specific trading patterns observed, resulting in a model that balances high true-positive detection with minimal noise.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment? | Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano et.al. | [2503.03612](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | VWAP Execution with Signature-Enhanced Transformers: A Multi-Asset Learning Approach | Remi Genet et.al. | [2503.02680](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02680) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/DynamicVWAPTransformer)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper I propose a novel approach to Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution that addresses two key practical challenges: the need for asset-specific model training and the capture of complex temporal dependencies. Building upon my recent work in dynamic VWAP execution arXiv:2502.18177, I demonstrate that a single neural network trained across multiple assets can achieve performance comparable to or better than traditional asset-specific models. The proposed architecture combines a transformer-based design inspired by arXiv:2406.02486 with path signatures for capturing geometric features of price-volume trajectories, as in arXiv:2406.17890. The empirical analysis, conducted on hourly cryptocurrency trading data from 80 trading pairs, shows that the globally-fitted model with signature features (GFT-Sig) achieves superior performance in both absolute and quadratic VWAP loss metrics compared to asset-specific approaches. Notably, these improvements persist for out-of-sample assets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different market conditions. The results suggest that combining global parameter sharing with signature-based feature extraction provides a scalable and robust approach to VWAP execution, offering significant practical advantages over traditional asset-specific implementations.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market | Katarzyna Chęć, Bartosz Uniejewski, Rafał Weron et.al. | [2503.02518](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</details> |
| 2025-03-01 | Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures | Hari P. Krishnan, Stephan Sturm et.al. | [2503.00603](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603) |  | 19 pages, 1 figure | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</details> |
| 2025-03-04 | Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead | Richard Gerlach, Antonio Naimoli, Giuseppe Storti et.al. | [2502.20978](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</details> |
| 2025-02-26 | Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph | Shiqi Wang, Zhibo Zhang, Libing Fang et.al. | [2502.19305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305) | **[link](https://github.com/wangskyGit/KeHGN-R)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that conduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal insider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate rich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year financial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We analyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two pronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy) non-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in Graph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large percentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden fraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and compromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage Learning ( ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to mitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations. The proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness against hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the importance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\rm KeGCN}_{R}$ over a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and robustness.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks | Remi Genet et.al. | [2502.18177](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177) | **[link](https://github.com/remigenet/deepdynamicvwap)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</details> |
| 2025-02-25 | LLM Knows Geometry Better than Algebra: Numerical Understanding of LLM-Based Agents in A Trading Arena | Tianmi Ma, Jiawei Du, Wenxin Huang et.al. | [2502.17967](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967) | **[link](https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/agent-trading-arena)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their ability to generalize to dynamic, unseen tasks, particularly in numerical reasoning, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LLMs on problems with predefined optimal solutions, which may not align with real-world scenarios where clear answers are absent. To bridge this gap, we design the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual numerical game simulating complex economic systems through zero-sum games, where agents invest in stock portfolios. Our experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic reasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local details rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly better with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as scatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance numerical reasoning. This capability is further improved by incorporating the reflection module, which aids in the analysis and interpretation of complex data. We validate our findings on NASDAQ Stock dataset, where LLMs demonstrate stronger reasoning with visual data compared to text. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.git.</details> |
| 2025-02-24 | A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk | Jan Fialkowski, Christian Diem, András Borsos et.al. | [2502.17044](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044) | **[link](https://github.com/JanFialkowski/FSRI_Plus)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and financial systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-22 | Contrastive Similarity Learning for Market Forecasting: The ContraSim Framework | Nicholas Vinden, Raeid Saqur, Zining Zhu et.al. | [2502.16023](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16023) |  | 8 pages, 3 appendices | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce the Contrastive Similarity Space Embedding Algorithm (ContraSim), a novel framework for uncovering the global semantic relationships between daily financial headlines and market movements. ContraSim operates in two key stages: (I) Weighted Headline Augmentation, which generates augmented financial headlines along with a semantic fine-grained similarity score, and (II) Weighted Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (WSSCL), an extended version of classical self-supervised contrastive learning that uses the similarity metric to create a refined weighted embedding space. This embedding space clusters semantically similar headlines together, facilitating deeper market insights. Empirical results demonstrate that integrating ContraSim features into financial forecasting tasks improves classification accuracy from WSJ headlines by 7%. Moreover, leveraging an information density analysis, we find that the similarity spaces constructed by ContraSim intrinsically cluster days with homogeneous market movement directions, indicating that ContraSim captures market dynamics independent of ground truth labels. Additionally, ContraSim enables the identification of historical news days that closely resemble the headlines of the current day, providing analysts with actionable insights to predict market trends by referencing analogous past events.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Multi-Agent Stock Prediction Systems: Machine Learning Models, Simulations, and Real-Time Trading Strategies | Daksh Dave, Gauransh Sawhney, Vikhyat Chauhan et.al. | [2502.15853](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15853) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper presents a comprehensive study on stock price prediction, leveragingadvanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve financial forecasting accuracy. The research evaluates the performance of various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and attention-based models. These models are assessed for their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies inherent in stock market data. Our findings show that attention-based models outperform other architectures, achieving the highest accuracy by capturing both short and long-term dependencies. This study contributes valuable insights into AI-driven financial forecasting, offering practical guidance for developing more accurate and efficient trading systems.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM) | Tianzuo Hu et.al. | [2502.15822](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market | Ilias Aarab, Thomas Gottron et.al. | [2502.15611](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611) |  | This is the preprint version of the paper published in: Aarab, I.,   Gottron, T. (2024). Network Topology of the Euro Area Interbank Market. In:   Mingione, M., Vichi, M., Zaccaria, G. (eds) *High-quality and Timely   Statistics*. CESS 2022. Studies in Theoretical and Applied Statistics.   Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63630-1_1 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</details> |
| 2025-02-21 | Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets | Bastien Buchwalter, Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz et.al. | [2502.15458](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</details> |
| 2025-02-20 | Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework | Arno Botha, Tanja Verster, Roland Breedt et.al. | [2502.14479](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479) |  | 33 pages, 8192 words, 12 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</details> |

The dynamics of different sectors are also compared. We use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on multidimensional time-series to identify crashes in stock and commodity markets. The Wasserstein Distance WD shows distinct spikes signaling the crash for both stock and commodity markets. We then compare the persistence diagrams of stock and commodity markets using the WD metric. A significant spike in the $WD$ between stock and commodity markets is observed during the crisis, suggesting significant topological differences between the markets. Similar spikes are observed between the sectors of the US market as well. Spikes obtained may be due to either a difference in the magnitude of crashes in the two markets (or sectors), or from the temporal lag between the two markets suggesting information flow. We study the Granger-causality between stock and commodity markets and also between different sectors. The results show a bidirectional Granger-causality between commodity and stock during the crash period, demonstrating the greater interdependence of financial markets during the crash. However, the overall analysis shows that the causal direction is from stock to commodity. A pairwise Granger-causal analysis between US sectors is also conducted. There is a significant increase in the interdependence between the sectors during the crash period. TDA combined with Granger-causality effectively analyzes the interdependence and sensitivity of different markets and sectors.</details> |

| 2025-03-13 | Unifying monitoring and modelling of water concentration levels in surface waters | Peter B Sorensen, Anders Nielsen, Peter E Holm et.al. | [2503.10285](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10285) |  | 41 pages, 11 figures, Developed to support the Danish EPA | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Accurate prediction of expected concentrations is essential for effective catchment management, requiring both extensive monitoring and advanced modeling techniques. However, due to limitations in the equation solving capacity, the integration of monitoring and modeling has been suffering suboptimal statistical approaches. This limitation results in models that can only partially leverage monitoring data, thus being an obstacle for realistic uncertainty assessments by overlooking critical correlations between both measurements and model parameters. This study presents a novel solution that integrates catchment monitoring and a unified hieratical statistical catchment modeling that employs a log-normal distribution for residuals within a left-censored likelihood function to address measurements below detection limits. This enables the estimation of concentrations within sub-catchments in conjunction with a source/fate sub-catchment model and monitoring data. This approach is possible due to a model builder R package denoted RTMB. The proposed approach introduces a statistical paradigm based on a hierarchical structure, capable of accommodating heterogeneous sampling across various sampling locations and the authors suggest that this also will encourage further refinement of other existing modeling platforms within the scientific community to improve synergy with monitoring programs. The application of the method is demonstrated through an analysis of nickel concentrations in Danish surface waters.</details> |

However, they remain computationally expensive when high accuracy requires large least squares problems to be solved. Domain decomposition methods (DDMs) for ELMs have allowed parallel computation to reduce training times of large systems. This paper constructs a coarse space for ELMs, which enables further acceleration of their training. By partitioning interface variables into coarse and non-coarse variables, selective elimination introduces a Schur complement system on the non-coarse variables with the coarse problem embedded. Key to the performance of the proposed method is a Neumann-Neumann acceleration that utilizes the coarse space. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speedup compared to a previous DDM method for ELMs.</details> |

To address these limitations, this study explores the usage of the newly introduced Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM) network in combination with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for automated stock trading. Our proposed method utilizes xLSTM networks in both actor and critic components, enabling effective handling of time series data and dynamic market environments. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation, is employed to optimize the trading strategy. Experiments were conducted using financial data from major tech companies over a comprehensive timeline, demonstrating that the xLSTM-based model outperforms LSTM-based methods in key trading evaluation metrics, including cumulative return, average profitability per trade, maximum earning rate, maximum pullback, and Sharpe ratio. These findings mark the potential of xLSTM for enhancing DRL-based stock trading systems.</details> |

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</details> |

To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them.

| 2025-03-12 | Large-scale Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser Beam Welding Using High-Performance Computing: A Qualitative Reproduction of Experimental Results | Tommaso Bevilacqua, Andrey Gumenyuk, Niloufar Habibi et.al. | [2503.09345](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09345) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Laser beam welding is a non-contact joining technique that has gained significant importance in the course of the increasing degree of automation in industrial manufacturing. This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.   The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</details> |

| 2025-03-11 | Capturing Lifecycle System Degradation in Digital Twin Model Updating | Yifan Tang, Mostafa Rahmani Dehaghani, G. Gary Wang et.al. | [2503.08953](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08953) |  | 32 pages, 25 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a powerful tool to facilitate monitoring, control, and other decision-making tasks in real-world engineering systems. Online update methods have been proposed to update DT models. Considering the degradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT models to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over time. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters have been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation parameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments. To mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for DT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses without any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system. The core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the lifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters with a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong update process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters of all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into account the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation stage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation stages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables prediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted latent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is reconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system responses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on two engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could capture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle.</details> |

Nathan Kutz et.al. | [2503.08904](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904) | **[link](https://github.com/ermete-lab/nushred)** | arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.12550 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</details> |

Kerswell et.al. | [2503.08283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08283) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We investigate the energy transfer from the mean profile to velocity fluctuations in channel flow by calculating nonlinear optimal disturbances,i.e. the initial condition of a given finite energy that achieves the highest possible energy growth during a given fixed time horizon. It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined.</details> |

This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</details> |

Tessone et.al. | [2503.07834](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07834) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Uniswap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automatic token exchange without the need for traditional order books. Every pair of tokens forms a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and each token can be paired with any other token to create liquidity pools. This characteristic motivates us to employ a complex network approach to analyze the features of the Uniswap market. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the Uniswap network using complex network methods. The network on October 31, 2023, is built to observe its recent features, showcasing both scale-free and core-periphery properties. By employing node and edge-betweenness metrics, we detect the most important tokens and liquidity pools. Additionally, we construct daily networks spanning from the beginning of Uniswap V2 on May 5, 2020, until October 31, 2023, and our findings demonstrate that the network becomes increasingly fragile over time. Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis by simulating the deletion of nodes to estimate the impact of some extreme events such as the Terra collapse. The results indicate that the Uniswap network exhibits robustness, yet it is notably fragile when deleting tokens with high betweenness centrality. This finding highlights that, despite being a decentralized exchange, Uniswap exhibits significant centralization tendencies in terms of token network connectivity and the distribution of TVL across nodes (tokens) and edges (liquidity pools).</details> |

For Li-S to reach commercial application, it is essential to understand how the behaviour scales between cell formats; new material development is predominately completed at coin-cell level, whilst pouch-cells will be used for commercial applications. Differences such as reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios and increased geometric size at larger cell formats contribute to the behavioural differences, in terms of achievable capacity, cyclability and potential degradation mechanisms.   This work focuses on the steps required to capture and test coin-cell behaviour, building upon the existing models within the literature, which predominately focus on pouch-cells. The areas investigated throughout this study, to improve the capability of the model in terms of scaling ability and causality of predictions, include the cathode surface area, precipitation dynamics and C-rate dependence.</details> |
| 2025-03-10 | Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Bearing Fault Detection using Piezoelectric Cantilevers | P. Peralta-Braz, M. M. Alamdari, C. T. Chou et.al. | [2503.07462](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07462) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, yet their vulnerability to faults often leads to costly breakdowns. Conventional fault detection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing, digitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that significantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors, accelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work proposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous vibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to specific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as the key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the machinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital conversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the sensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach, we use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets, examining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also consider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices, and the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested energy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and severities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a diagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance strategy for fault detection in smart machinery.</details> |

| 2025-03-10 | An Analytics-Driven Approach to Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning | Ge Zheng, Alexandra Brintrup et.al. | [2503.07231](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07231) |  | 15 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to a journal | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In today's globalised trade, supply chains form complex networks spanning multiple organisations and even countries, making them highly vulnerable to disruptions. These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises, underscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply chain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of comprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy, security, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies focused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the multifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world supply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to enhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain knowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by facilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower the framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs, enabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide comprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge graphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates proactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and adaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.</details> |

The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$ -consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case. Through different numerical applications involving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation possesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex systems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy.</details> |

With digital fabrication technology, this study explores the transition from traditional, single function building facades to multifunctional, integrated building systems. It introduces a photobioreactor (PBR) fa\c{c}ade system to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations while addressing the challenge of large-scale prefabricated components transportation. This research introduces a novel approach by designing the fa\c{c}ade system as modular, user-friendly and transportation-friendly bricks, enabling the creation of a user-customized and self-assembled photobioreactor (PBR) system. The single module in the system is proposed to be "neutralization bricks", which embedded with algae and equipped with an air circulation system, facilitating the photobioreactor (PBR)'s functionality. A connection system between modules allows for easy assembly by users, while a limited variety of brick styles ensures modularity in manufacturing without sacrificing customization and diversity. The system is also equipped with an advanced microalgae status detection algorithm, which allows users to monitor the condition of the microalgae using monocular camera. This functionality ensures timely alerts and notifications for users to replace the algae, thereby optimizing the operational efficiency and sustainability of the algae cultivation process.</details> |

These power losses not only increase end-to-end latency, but also compromise inference consistency and accuracy, as existing checkpointing and restore mechanisms are prone to errors. Consequently, the quality of service (QoS) for DNN inference on EH devices is severely impacted. In this paper, we propose an energy-adaptive DNN inference mechanism capable of dynamically transitioning the model into a low-power mode by reducing computational complexity when harvested energy is limited. This approach ensures that end-to-end latency requirements are met. Additionally, to address the limitations of error-prone checkpoint-and-restore mechanisms, we introduce a checkpoint-free intermittent inference framework that ensures consistent, progress-preserving DNN inference during power failures in energy-harvesting systems.</details> |

We use a proven setup as the foundation for our environment with multiple extensions. The features of our trading agent are constantly being expanded to include additional assets such as commodities, resulting in four models. We also respond to environmental conditions, including costs and crises. Our trading agent is first trained for a specific time period and tested on new data and compared with the long-and-hold strategy as a benchmark (market). We analyze the differences between the various models and the in-sample/out-of-sample performance with respect to the environment. The experimental results show that the trading agent follows an appropriate behavior. It can adjust its policy to different circumstances, such as more extensive use of the neutral position when trading costs are present. Furthermore, the net asset value exceeded that of the benchmark, and the agent outperformed the market in the test set. We provide initial insights into the behavior of an agent in a financial domain using a DDQN algorithm. The results of this study can be used for further development.</details> |

Most classical statistical models may have certain limitations when applied to practical scenarios in fields such as energy, healthcare, traffic, meteorology, and economics, especially when high accuracy is required. With the continuous development of deep learning, numerous new models have emerged in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. However, existing surveys have not provided a unified summary of the wide range of model architectures in this field, nor have they given detailed summaries of works in feature extraction and datasets. To address this gap, in this review, we comprehensively study the previous works and summarize the general paradigms of Deep Time Series Forecasting (DTSF) in terms of model architectures. Besides, we take an innovative approach by focusing on the composition of time series and systematically explain important feature extraction methods. Additionally, we provide an overall compilation of datasets from various domains in existing works. Finally, we systematically emphasize the significant challenges faced and future research directions in this field.</details> |

Transformer effectively combines information from the past input and output samples in auto-regressive manner so that each sample becomes aware of all inputs and outputs. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling, the transformer processed samples become effective in predicting the next output. Time series forecasting is a Seq2Seq problem. The original architecture is defined for discrete input and output sequence tokens, but to adopt it for time series, the model must be adapted for continuous data. This work introduces minimal adaptations to make the original transformer architecture suitable for continuous value time series data.</details> |

Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</details> |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</details> |

A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic patterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on network architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies. Inspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series predictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different frequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method based on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through spectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral components and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series. Unlike signal decomposition, which represents the original series as a linear combination of basis signals, our method uses a transformer model to compute cross-attention between the original series and reference series, capturing essential features for forecasting. Experiments on major open and synthetic datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by focusing on attention with a small number of reference series rather than pairwise variable attention, our method ensures scalability and broad applicability.

However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</details> |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</details> |

However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</details> |

Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</details> |
| 2025-03-08 | A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM | Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu et.al. | [2503.06216](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06216) |  | 23 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</details> |

The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</details> |

However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

Wells et.al. | [2503.04956](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04956) |  | 40 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper we propose a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem where the loss of a classification decision is only observed at a future time point after the classification decision has to be made. To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</details> |

However, traditional hedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero transaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and uncertain real-world markets.   With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading strategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a derivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement learning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a hedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and hedging.   Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic financial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of derivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses high-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing nonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies within this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and constructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.   Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop a risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging as a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior cloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's performance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets demonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.</details> |

The challenge intensifies when anomalies are sparse and the data are multivariate with relational dependencies across sensors or nodes. Traditional univariate anomaly detectors struggle to capture such cross-node dependencies, particularly in sparse anomaly settings. To address this, we propose a graph-augmented time series forecasting approach that explicitly integrates the graph of relationships among time series into an LSTM forecasting model. This enables the model to detect rare anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed in purely univariate approaches. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark datasets - the Yahoo Webscope S5 anomaly dataset and the METR-LA traffic sensor network - and compare the performance of the Graph-Augmented LSTM against LSTM-only, ARIMA, and Prophet baselines. Results demonstrate that the graph-augmented model achieves significantly higher precision and recall, improving F1-score by up to 10% over the best baseline</details> |

Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.

Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</details> |

Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</details> |

To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContexTST advances state-of-the-art forecasting performance while achieving strong zero-shot transferability across diverse domains.</details> |

Given a ground truth configuration of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^\ell$, we observe a subset of the pairwise distances and aim to recover the underlying configuration (up to rigid transformations). We show with a simple counterexample that the associated optimization problem is nonconvex and may admit spurious local minimizers, even when all distances are known. Yet, inspired by numerical experiments, we argue that all second-order critical points become global minimizers when the problem is relaxed by optimizing over configurations in dimension $k > \ell$. Specifically, we show this for two settings, both when all pairwise distances are known: (1) for arbitrary ground truth points, and $k= O(\sqrt{\ell n})$, and: (2) for isotropic random ground truth points, and $k = O(\ell + \log n)$ .

However, modeling their behavior is challenging because of the complex interplay between oxygen availability, drug activation, and cell survival. In this work, we develop a multiscale and mixed-dimensional model that couples spatially resolved drug and oxygen transport with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to simulate the cellular response. The model integrates blood flow, oxygen diffusion and consumption, drug delivery, and metabolism. To reduce computational cost, we mitigate the global nonlinearity through a one-way coupling of the multiscale and mixed/dimensional models with a reduced 0D model for the drug metabolism. The global sensitivity analysis is then used to identify key parameters influencing drug activation and therapeutic outcome. This approach enables efficient simulation and supports the design of optimized hypoxia-targeted therapies.</details> |

The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin $-$ a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon.</details> |

A key component in this process is beamforming, with the Delay and Sum (DAS) algorithm being a standard due to its balance between simplicity and effectiveness. However, the computational cost of DAS can be a limiting factor, especially in real-time scenarios where fast frame reconstruction is essential. In this work, we introduce a time-invariant approximation of the DAS algorithm (tiDAS), designed to accelerate the reconstruction process without compromising image quality. By adopting a one-dimensional, row-wise convolutional formulation, tiDAS significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving the core properties of the original model. This approach not only enables faster image reconstruction but also provides a structured foundation for the application of deconvolution methods aimed at enhancing resolution. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that tiDAS achieves a favorable trade-off between speed and accuracy, making it a promising tool for improving the efficiency of real-time ultrasound imaging.</details> |

The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$ -errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</details> |

These systems are typically ill-conditioned because of the presence of embedded lower-dimensional structures and are solved using Krylov subspace methods. Our approach yields an approximation of the inverse operator employing a learning algorithm consisting of a two-stage training framework: an initial static pre-training phase, based on residual minimization, followed by a dynamic fine-tuning phase that incorporates solver convergence dynamics into training via a novel loss functional. This dynamic loss is defined by the principal angles between the residuals and the Krylov subspaces. It is evaluated using a differentiable implementation of the Flexible GMRES algorithm, which enables backpropagation through both the Arnoldi process and Givens rotations. The resulting neural preconditioner is explicitly optimized to improve early-stage convergence and reduce iteration counts in a family of 3D-1D mixed-dimensional problems with geometric variability of the 1D domain. Numerical experiments show that our solver-aligned approach significantly improves convergence rate, robustness, and generalization.</details> |

Various scientific and engineering applications demand a versatile and differentiable PDE solver that can quickly generate solutions with adequate accuracy, and limitations of the traditional solvers and specialized neural operators motivate the development of foundation models for solving PDEs. This paper introduces PDEformer-2, a versatile foundation model for two-dimensional PDEs. Based on our previous one-dimensional PDEformer-1 model, PDEformer-2 receives the PDE form as network input via computational graph representation, which has the flexibility to encode most common PDEs. The mesh-free predicted solutions can be directly queried at arbitrary spatio-temporal coordinates. A large (40TB) diverse dataset is employed to pretrain the current model, making it capable of simultaneously addressing PDEs with different symbolic forms, domain shapes, boundary conditions, number of variables, and time-dependency. Accurate zero-shot prediction is allowed for PDEs that resemble the pretraining ones. When adapted to new unseen PDEs, PDEformer-2 demonstrates faster learning than many specialized models, and has smaller errors given limited (less than 100) samples. Additionally, PDEformer-2 can be employed in the inverse problems thanks to its fast and differentiable nature and produces reasonable results in our experiments to recover coefficient scalars and fields of a PDE.</details> |

The ROHF model is parametrized using reference simulations of the conductor response, after which it enables the computation of macroscopic quantities such as voltage and power loss without requiring detailed electromagnetic field solutions. It is therefore suitable for the homogenization of transport current effects in large-scale superconducting magnets, avoiding a fine discretization of the composite strand small scale structures, allowing to drastically reduce the computational effort. The approximation can be implemented either (i) as a rate-independent model, neglecting eddy current effects in the normal conducting matrix, or (ii) as a rate-dependent model, including those eddy current effects. In this paper, the complete modeling workflow, including parameter identification, coupling with the other fields (temperature and magnetic field), and post-processing of the results, is described and verified using a twisted multifilamentary strand as an example.</details> |

We identify the points at which the convergence rates of the first- and second-order derivatives of the interpolant converge faster. We further extend the analysis to the Hermite spectral collocation method in solving differential equations and identify the superconvergence points both for function and derivative values. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the analysis of superconvergence points.</details> |

The initial data are assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 < gamma < 2, where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</details> |

This modelling allows for the simplified description of simultaneous interactions among multiple elements in coupled oscillators, graph neural networks, and entangled qubits. Here, we employ this generalized framework to describe wave-matter interactions for material design acceleration. By devising the set operations for multiparticle systems, we develop the hypergraph model, which compactly describes wave interferences among multiparticles in scattering events by hyperedges of different orders. This compactness enables an evolutionary algorithm with O(N1/2) time complexity and approximated accuracy for designing stealthy hyperuniform materials, which is superior to traditional methods of O(N) scaling. By hybridizing our hypergraph evolutions to the conventional collective-coordinate method, we preserve the original accuracy, while achieving substantial speed-up in approaching near the optimum. Our result paves the way toward scalable material design and compact interpretations of large-scale multiparticle systems.</details> |

We establish local R-linear convergence results for Anderson acceleration with general depth $m$ under the assumptions that the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator is H\"older continuous and the corresponding fixed-point function is contractive. In the Lipschitz continuous case, we obtain a sharper R-linear convergence factor. We also derive a refined residual bound for the depth $m = 1$ under the same assumptions used for the general depth results. Applications to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation from transport theory demonstrate that Anderson acceleration yields comparable results to several existing fixed-point methods for the regular cases, and that it brings significant reductions in both the number of iterations and computation time, even in challenging cases involving nearly singular or large-scale problems.</details> |

The systematic solution of these problems for every material point is a key ingredient for the efficient implementation of the model into standard magnetic field solvers. We propose to approximate the non-smooth terms via regularization which allows to employ standard Newton methods for the evaluation of the local material models while being in control of the error in this approximation. We further derive the inverse of the regularized hysteresis operator which amounts to a regularized version of the inverse hysteresis model. The magnetic polarizations in this model are again determined by local minimization problems which here are coupled across the different pinning forces. An efficient algorithm for solving the Newton systems is proposed which allows evaluation of the inverse hysteresis operator at the same cost as the forward model. Numerical tests on standard benchmark problems are presented for illustration of our results.</details> |

Using a von Neumann-type analysis, we investigate the stability of such low-rank time integrator coupled with standard spatial discretizations, including upwind and central finite difference schemes, under two commonly used formulations: discretize-then-project (DtP) and project-then-discretize (PtD). For hyperbolic equations, we show that the stability conditions for DtP and PtD are the same under Lie-Trotter splitting, and that the stability region can be significantly enlarged by using Strang splitting. For parabolic equations, despite the presence of a negative S-step, unconditional stability can still be achieved by employing Crank-Nicolson or a hybrid forward-backward Euler scheme in time stepping. While our analysis focuses on simplified model problems, it offers insight into the stability behavior of PSI for more complex systems, such as those arising in kinetic theory.</details> |

Matrix Anal. Appl., 43(2), 605-637], where $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is an arbitrary $(\beta m)$-sparse corruption. However, all existing theoretical guarantees for QRK require quantiles to be computed using all $m$ samples (or a subsample of the same order), thus negating the computational advantage of Kaczmarz-type methods. This paper overcomes the bottleneck. We analyze a subsampling QRK, which computes quantiles from $D$ uniformly chosen samples at each iteration. Under some standard scaling assumptions on the coefficient matrix, we show that QRK with subsample size $D\ge\frac{C\log (T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ linearly converges over the first $T$ iterations with high probability, where $C$ is some absolute constant. This subsample size is a substantial reduction from $O(m)$ in prior results. For instance, it translates into $O(\log(n))$ even if an approximation error of $\exp(-n^2)$ is desired. Intriguingly, our subsample size is also tight up to a multiplicative constant: if $D\le \frac{c\log(T)}{\log(1/\beta)}$ for some constant $c$, the error of the $T$ -th iterate could be arbitrarily large with high probability. Numerical results are provided to corroborate our theory.</details> |

Instead of allowing the bugs to spiral towards one another, we constrain $N$ bugs to the perimeter of the unit circle. Depending on their configuration, each bug moves either clockwise or counterclockwise with a constant angular speed, or remains stationary. Unlike the original problem where bugs always coalesce, this generalization produces three possible steady states: all bugs coalescing to a single point, clusters of bugs located at two antipodal points, or bugs entering a stable infinite chase cycle where they never meet. We analyze the stability of these steady states and calculate the probability that randomly initialized bugs reach each state. For $N \leq 4$ , we derive exact analytical expressions for these probabilities. For larger values, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of coalescing, finding it approximately follows an inverse square root relationship with the number of bugs. This generalization reveals rich dynamical behaviors that are absent in the classic problem. Our analysis provides insight into how restricting the bugs to the circle's perimeter fundamentally alters the long-term behavior of pursuing agents compared to unrestricted pursuit problems.</details> |

Exact self-energies are required to satisfy the mathematical condition of positive semi-definiteness. The $GW$ self-energy fulfills this property, but the vast majority of the vertex-corrected self-energy approximations do not. In this study, we devise a positive semi-definite extension to the $GW$+2SOSEX self-energy that we name $GW$+2SOSEX-psd. To reach this goal, we demonstrate the cancellation of the bare energy poles that are contained in the fully dynamic second-order in $W$ self-energy ($G3W2$ ). We then demonstrate on molecular examples the correct positive semi-definiteness of the proposed self-energy approximation and its good accuracy in predicting accurate quasiparticle energies for valence and core states.</details> |

Unlike the multi-layer shallow water equations, which model vertical velocity variations using multiple distinct layers, the SWLME employs a polynomial expansion of velocity profiles with up to $N$ moments. This approach enables a more detailed representation of vertical momentum transfer and complex velocity profiles while retaining hyperbolicity. However, the presence of non-conservative terms and complex steady-state structures introduces significant numerical challenges. Addressing these challenges, we develop path-conservative DG schemes grounded in the Dal Maso-LeFloch-Murat (DLM) theory for non-conservative products. Our method balances flux gradients, non-conservative terms, and source terms through equilibrium-preserving spaces. For the still water equilibrium, we reformulate the equations into a quasilinear form that eliminates source terms, inherently preserving steady states. For the moving water equilibrium, we extend the DG method by transforming conservative variables into equilibrium variables and employing linear segment paths. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve exact equilibrium preservation while maintaining high-order accuracy, even in scenarios with vertical velocity variations and complex topographies.</details> |

The phase-field variable is assumed to follow the non-conservative Allen-Cahn evolution law, whereas the solute ion concentration obeys the conservative Cahn-Hilliard equation. We also assess the convergence of the new model to the corresponding sharp-interface model via the method of matched asymptotic expansions, and derive a novel expression of the reaction rate of the sharp-interface model. Through a finite element discretization, we present several numerical examples in two and three dimensions.</details> |

The proposed method decouples the modeling of the antenna and its surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs) that rigorously capture the electromagnetic interactions with multilayered spherical environments. This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary material variations without re-simulating the antenna, offering substantial computational advantages over traditional dyadic Green's function (DGF)-based MoM approaches. The framework supports a wide range of spherical media, including radially inhomogeneous and uniaxially anisotropic layers. Extensive case studies demonstrate excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, confirming the method's accuracy, generality, and scalability. Code implementations are provided to facilitate adoption and future development.</details> |

Our approach is based on the original raw algorithm on several unknowns, thereby avoiding the need for a transformation into an equivalent scalar formulation-a challenging process in presence of boundaries. To address different behaviors exhibited by the numerical scheme, we introduce appropriate notions of strong stability. They account for the potential absence of a continuous extension of the stable vector bundle associated with the bulk scheme on the unit circle for certain components. Rather than developing a general theory, complicated by the fact that discrete boundaries in lattice Boltzmann schemes are inherently characteristic, we focus on strong stability-instability for methods whose characteristic equations have stencils of breadth one to the left. In this context, we study three representative schemes. These are endowed with various boundary conditions drawn from the literature, and our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</details> |

It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.</details> |

To this day, this problem remains difficult, in particular because the equations are neither Hermitian nor semi-definite. Our approach is to compare different strategies for solving this set of equations with preconditioners that are available either in PETSc, MUMPS, or in hypre. Four different preconditioners are considered. The first is the sparse approximate inverse, which is often applied to electromagnetic problems. The second is Restricted Additive Schwarz, a domain decomposition preconditioner. The third is the Hiptmair-Xu preconditioner which is tailored to the positive Maxwell equations, a nearby problem. The final preconditioner is MUMPS's Block Low-Rank method, a compressed block procedure. We also compare the performance of this method to the standard LU factorization technique, which is a direct solver. Performance with respect to the mesh size, the number of CPU cores, the wavelength and the physical size of the domain are considered. This work in progress yields temporary conclusions in favour of the Hiptmair-Xu and the Block Low-Rank preconditioners.</details> |

Using the spherically averaged Ewald interaction as this intermediate reference system for the uniform electron gas, the interaction contribution for the free energy was evaluated up to 18 times faster than the Ewald-only method. Furthermore, a $\xi$ -extrapolation technique was tested and applied to alleviate the fermion sign problem and to resolve the sign for large particle numbers. Combining these two techniques enabled the evaluation of the free energy for a system of 1000 electrons, where both finite-size and statistical errors are below chemical accuracy. The general procedure can be applied to systems relevant for planetary and inertial confinement fusion modeling with low to moderate levels of quantum degeneracy.</details> |

While deep-learning-based approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM), offer mesh-free alternatives, they often lack adaptive resolution in critical regions, limiting their accuracy for solutions with steep gradients or singularities. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Feature Capture Method (AFCM), a novel machine learning framework that adaptively redistributes neurons and collocation points in high-gradient regions to enhance local expressive power. Inspired by adaptive moving mesh techniques, AFCM employs the gradient norm of an approximate solution as a monitor function to guide the reinitialization of feature function parameters. This ensures that partition hyperplanes and collocation points cluster where they are most needed, achieving higher resolution without increasing computational overhead. The AFCM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with near-singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in accurately resolving low-regularity problems, even in complex geometries. By bridging the gap between adaptive mesh refinement and randomized neural networks, AFCM offers a robust and scalable approach for solving challenging PDEs in scientific and engineering applications.</details> |

The recently introduced hyperspin machine, which is a network of linearly and nonlinearly coupled parametric oscillators, provides a versatile simulator of general classical vector spin models in arbitrary dimension, finding the minimum of the simulated spin Hamiltonian and implementing novel annealing algorithms. In the hyperspin machine, oscillators evolve in time minimizing a cost function that must resemble the desired spin Hamiltonian in order for the system to reliably simulate the target spin model. This condition is met if the hyperspin amplitudes are equal in the steady state. Currently, no mechanism to enforce equal amplitudes exists. Here, we bridge this gap and introduce a method to simulate the hyperspin machine with equalized amplitudes in the steady state. We employ an additional network of oscillators (named equalizers) that connect to the hyperspin machine via an antisymmetric nonlinear coupling and equalize the hyperspin amplitudes. We demonstrate the performance of such an equalized hyperspin machine by large-scale numerical simulations up to $10000$ hyperspins. Compared to the hyperspin machine without equalization, we find that the equalized hyperspin machine (i) Reaches orders of magnitude lower spin energy, and (ii) Its performance is significantly less sensitive to the system parameters. The equalized hyperspin machine offers a competitive spin Hamiltonian minimizer and opens the possibility to combine amplitude equalization with complex annealing protocols to further boost the performance of spin machines.</details> |

Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</details> |

Zhang et.al. | [2507.12791](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12791) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce a new method for analyzing midpoint discretizations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are frequently used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from a target measure $\pi \propto \exp(-V)$. Borrowing techniques from Malliavin calculus, we compute estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative for processes on $L^2([0, T); \mathbb{R}^d)$ which may anticipate the Brownian motion, in the sense that they may not be adapted to the filtration at the same time. Applying these to various popular midpoint discretizations, we are able to improve the regularity and cross-regularity results in the literature on sampling methods. We also obtain a query complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\kappa^{5/4} d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}})$ for obtaining a $\varepsilon^2$-accurate sample in $\mathsf{KL}$ divergence, under log-concavity and strong smoothness assumptions for $\nabla^2 V$ .</details> |

However, the performance of single operator block is often limited, thus often requiring composition of basic operator blocks to achieve better per-formance. The traditional way of composition is staking those blocks like feedforward neural networks, which may not be very economic considering parameter-efficiency tradeoff. In this pa-per, we propose a novel dual path architecture that significantly enhances the capabilities of basic neural operators. The basic operator block is organized in parallel two paths which are similar with ResNet and DenseNet. By introducing this parallel processing mechanism, our architecture shows a more powerful feature extraction and solution approximation ability compared with the original model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive numerical experi-ments on a variety of PDE problems, including the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow Equation and the 2d Navier-Stokes equation. The experimental results indicate that on certain standard test cas-es, our model achieves a relative improvement of over 30% compared to the basic model. We also apply this structure on two standard neural operators (DeepONet and FNO) selected from different paradigms, which suggests that the proposed architecture has excellent versatility and offering a promising direction for neural operator structure design.</details> |

We propose and analyze a symplectic, second-order algorithm for the evolutionary MHD system in Els\"asser variables. We reduce the computational cost of the iterative non-linear solver, at each time step, by partitioning the coupled system into two subproblems of half size, solved in parallel. We prove that the iterations converge linearly, under a time step restriction similar to the one required in the full space-time error analysis. The variable step algorithm unconditionally conserves the energy, cross-helicity and magnetic helicity, and numerical solutions are second-order accurate in the $L^{2}$ and $H^{1}$ -norms. The time adaptive mechanism, based on a local truncation error criterion, helps the variable step algorithm balance accuracy and time efficiency. Several numerical tests support the theoretical findings and verify the advantage of time adaptivity.</details> |

Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to compute an $\epsilon$ -approximate first-order critical point of the bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training, illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.</details> |

A few applications dominated by dense matrix operations have seen substantial speedups by utilizing low precision formats such as FP16. However, a majority of scientific simulation applications are memory bandwidth limited. Beyond preliminary studies, the practical gain from using mixed-precision algorithms on a given HPC system is largely unclear.   The High Performance GMRES Mixed Precision (HPG-MxP) benchmark has been proposed to measure the useful performance of a HPC system on sparse matrix-based mixed-precision applications.

While much of the existing research has focused on international migration, migration patterns within a single country remain relatively unexplored. In this work we study internal migration patterns in Austria for a period of over 20 years, obtained from open and high-granularity administrative records. We employ inferential network methods to characterize the flows between municipalities and extract their clustering according to similar target and destination rates. Our methodology reveals significant deviations from commonly assumed relocation patterns modeled by the gravity law. At the same time, we observe unexpected biases of internal migrations that leads to less frequent movements across boundaries at both district and state levels than predictions suggest. This leads to significant regionalization of migration at multiple geographical scales and augmented division between urban and rural areas. These patterns appear to be remarkably persistent across decades of migration data, demonstrating systematic limitations of conventionally used gravity models in migration studies. Our approach presents a robust methodology that can be used to improve such evaluations, and can reveal new phenomena in migration networks.</details> |

While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</details> |

An efficient flushing strategy may reduce water consumption and the cost associated with water usage, and help water conservation for sustainability. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with the kinetic theory of granular flow for the flushing process is presented. The CFD models were validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128 $km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than 15\% for outlet solid concentration over time. A parametric study evaluated the effects of water velocity (1.88-5.88~$m/s$), bubble size (50~$\mu m$, 150~$\mu m$, and 1000~$\mu m$) and bubble volume fraction (0.05-0.2) on flushing performance including pipeline cleanness, cleanness efficiency, and water consumption. The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is preferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$ reduces the water consumption by $28\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing process and increase the water consumption by $23\%$. Remarkably, small bubbles facilitates the flushing process and lead to $35\%$ reduction in water consumption. These effects are attributed to the turbulent characteristics in the pipelines in presence of microbubbles.</details> |

Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</details> |

Presents TMMax: a Python package for fast   and differentiable modeling of multilayer thin-film structures using the   transfer matrix method with JAX. Repository:   https://github.com/bahremsd/tmmax | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Optical multilayer thin-films are fundamental components that enable the precise control of reflectance, transmittance, and phase shift in the design of photonic systems. Rapid and accessible simulation of these structures holds critical importance for designing and analyzing complex coatings, such as distributed Bragg reflectors, anti-reflection layers, and spectral filters. While researchers commonly use the traditional transfer matrix method for designing these structures, its scalar approach to wavelength and angle of incidence causes redundant recalculations and inefficiencies in large-scale simulations. Furthermore, traditional method implementations do not support automatic differentiation, which limits their applicability in gradient-based inverse design approaches. Here, we present TMMax, a Python library that fully vectorizes and accelerates transfer matrix method using the high-performance machine learning library JAX. TMMax supports CPU, GPU, and TPU hardware, includes a publicly available material database, and offers comprehensive multilayer optical thin-film analysis tools. Our approach, demonstrated through benchmarking, allows us to model thin-film stacks with hundreds of layers within seconds. This illustrates that our method achieves a simulation speedup of x100s over a baseline NumPy implementation, providing a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Our method enables rapid and scalable simulations of large and complex multilayer thin-film structures, significantly accelerating the design process.</details> |

Motivated by the experimental findings from the tribology literature, we take the lubricant to be micropolar fluid and study its behavior in a thin domain with rough boundary. Instead of considering (commonly used) simple zero boundary condition, we impose physically relevant (nonzero) boundary condition for microrotation and perform asymptotic analysis of the corresponding 3D boundary value problem. We formally derive a simplified mathematical model acknowledging the roughness-induced effects and the effects of the nonzero boundary conditions on the macroscopic flow. Using the obtained asymptotic model, we study numerically the influence of the specific rugosity profile on the performance of a linear slider bearing. The numerical results clearly indicate that the use of the rough surfaces may contribute to enhance the mechanical performance of such device.</details> |

This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.</details> |

These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</details> |

Moreover, at each time-step the adaptive algorithm monitors the accuracy thanks to the error indicators and recomputes the current step on a refined mesh until the desired tolerance is met; meanwhile, the mesh is coarsened in regions of smaller errors. Leapfrog based local time-stepping is applied in all regions of local mesh refinement to incorporate adaptivity into fully explicit time integration with mesh change while retaining efficiency. Numerical results illustrate the optimal rate of convergence of the a posteriori error estimators on time evolving meshes.</details> |

For stable reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems.

Controlling robots, and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.</details> |

Seddon, Tamara Kohler et.al. | [2507.07912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07912) |  | 49+7 pages, 23 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real superconducting-qubit hardware.</details> |
| 2025-07-10 | Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics | Steven N. Rodriguez, Steven L. Brunton, Liam K. Magargal et.al. | [2507.07830](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</details> |

With $M$ points in the spatial discretization and $N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive implementation would require $\mathcal O(M^2N_t^2)$ work in dimensions where the weak Huygens' principle applies. We avoid this all-to-all interaction using a smoothly windowed decomposition into a local part, treated directly, plus a history part, approximated by a $N_F$-term Fourier series. In one dimension, our method requires $\mathcal O\left((M + N_F \log N_F)N_t\right)$ work, with $N_F =\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, by exploiting the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the method's performance for time-domain scattering problems involving a large number $M$ of springs (point scatterers) attached to a vibrating string at arbitrary locations, with either periodic or free-space boundary conditions. We typically achieve 10-digit accuracy, and include tests for $M$ up to a million.</details> |

The first-passage time (FPT) in such models plays a central role in understanding when a process first reaches a critical boundary. In many systems, time-dependent thresholds provide a flexible framework for reflecting evolving conditions, making them essential for realistic modelling. We propose a hybrid exact simulation scheme for computing the FPT of PDifMPs to time-dependent thresholds. Exact methods traditionally exist for pure diffusions, using Brownian motion as an auxiliary process and accepting sampled paths with a probability weight. Between jumps, the PDifMP evolves as a diffusion, allowing us to apply the exact method within each inter-jump interval. The main challenge arises when no threshold crossing is detected in an interval: We then need the value of the process at the jump time, and for that, we introduce an approach to simulate a conditionally constrained auxiliary process and derive the corresponding acceptance probability. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the method and illustrate it using numerical examples.</details> |

In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale $L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$ exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</details> |

This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local Lipschitz constants of the whole network.</details> |
| 2025-07-10 | Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR | Maximilian Bindhak, Art J. R. Pelling, Jens Saak et.al. | [2507.07788](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788) |  | Preprint | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR.   For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices.   The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</details> |

By applying the half-Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the relationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ , we reformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then convert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \textit{spectrum doubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the initial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals during the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For the resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose stability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and second-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error estimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large linear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a parallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the second-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection or for complex fractional Schr\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.</details> |

In this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case. Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular matrices.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.</details> |

We also find, analytically, the specific conditions on system parameters for the formation of localized region of an attractor.</details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that the approximation error of RFM exhibits spectral convergence when it is applied to the second-order elliptic equations in one dimension, provided that the solution belongs to Gevrey classes or Sobolev spaces. We highlight the significant impact of incorporating the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) to enhance the convergence of RFM by establishing the convergence rate in terms of the maximum patch size. Furthermore, we reveal that the singular values of the random feature matrix (RFMtx) decay exponentially, while its condition number increases exponentially as the number of the features grows. We also theoretically illustrate that PUM may mitigate the excessive decay of the singular values of RFMtx.</details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel locally implicit, but globally explicit ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively captures the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear test cases.</details> |

The first two   authors contributed equally | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</details> |

The coupled system is modeled using the method of regularized Stokeslets (MRS), a Lagrangian method for simulating fluid-structure interaction at zero Reynolds number. The linearized system is solved in a doubly periodic domain in a 3D fluid. The eigenvalues determine the theoretical critical time step for numerical stability for a forward Euler time integration, which are then verified numerically across several regularization functions, elastic models, and parameter choices. New doubly periodic regularized Stokeslets are presented, allowing for comparison of the stability properties of different regularization functions. The stability results for a common regularization function are approximated by a power law relating the regularization parameter and the surface discretization for two different elastic models. This relationship is empirically shown to hold in the different setting of a finite surface in a bulk fluid.</details> |

Huang and J. Shen, SIAM J Numer. Anal., 62.4, 1609--1637] for the parabolic type equations are studied in this paper. The basic idea is based on the Taylor expansions at time $t^{n+\beta}$ with $\beta>1$ being a tunable parameter. These new BDF schemes allow larger time steps at higher order r for stiff problems than that which allowed with a usual higher-order scheme. However, multi-step methods like BDF exhibit inherent disadvantages relative to one-step methods in practical implementations. In this paper, inspired by their excellent work, we construct a new class of high-order one-step schemes for linear parabolic-type equations. These new schemes, with several suitable $\beta_i$, can achieve A-stable, or even L-stable. Specially, the new scheme with special parameters $\beta_i$ can be regarded as the classical one-step Runge-Kutta scheme with a stabilized term. Besides, we provide two different techniques to construct the one-step high-order schemes: the first one is by choosing different parameters $\beta_i$ , and the second one is by increasing the number of intermediate layers. Both methods have been proven to be highly effective and even exhibit superconvergence property. Finally, we also conducted several numerical experiments to support our conclusions.</details> |

To overcome limitations from long-range effects and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored. Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore, the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium hydride at the level of CC theory.</details> |

Using the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a structure-preserving Finite Element Method.   To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports naturally occur.   Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system. Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.</details> |

Evans, Matteo Giacomini et.al. | [2507.06861](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06861) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric Stokes flows and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems is presented. The methodology relies on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method to reduce the dimensionality of the parametric flow fields and on an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) paradigm to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in space. The DD-PGD approach provides a non-intrusive framework in which end-users only need access to the matrices arising from the (finite element) discretization of the full-order problems in the subdomains. The traces of the finite element functions used for the discretization within the subdomains are employed to impose arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at the interface, without introducing auxiliary basis functions. The methodology is seamless to the choice of the discretization schemes in space, being compatible with both LBB-compliant finite element pairs and stabilized formulations, and the DD-PGD paradigm is transparent to the employed overlapping DD approach. The local surrogate models are glued together in the online phase by solving a parametric interface system to impose continuity of the subdomain solutions at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange multipliers to enforce the continuity in the entire overlap and without solving any additional physical problem in the reduced space. Numerical results are presented for parametric single-physics (Stokes-Stokes) and multi-physics (Stokes-Darcy) systems, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of DD-PGD, and its capability to outperform DD methods based on high-fidelity finite element solvers in terms of computing times.</details> |

We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends crucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the time of initialisation: (i) if C < 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the meridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time singularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C > 1, then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity. By examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights into the development of these singularities.</details> |

We demonstrate that for functions in $\mathscr{B}^{1/2}$, a shallow neural network (a single hidden layer) with $N$ units can achieve an $L^p$-approximation rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. This rate also applies to uniform approximation, differing by at most a logarithmic factor. Our results significantly reduce the smoothness requirement compared to existing theory, which necessitate functions to belong to $\mathscr{B}^1$ in order to attain the same rate. Furthermore, we show that increasing the network's depth can notably improve the approximation order for functions with small smoothness. Specifically, for networks with $L$ hidden layers, functions in $\mathscr{B}^s$ with $0 < sL \le 1/2$ can achieve an approximation rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-sL})$ . The rates and prefactors in our estimates are dimension-free. We also confirm the sharpness of our findings, with the lower bound closely aligning with the upper, with a discrepancy of at most one logarithmic factor.</details> |

We present the Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data. This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.</details> |

The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE- $\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</details> |

Our findings exhibit consistent bias decay across various scenarios, including applications to manifold-valued functions.</details> |

Currie et.al. | [2507.06673](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06673) |  | 14 pages, 11 figures, to be published in MNRAS | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities. Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of diffusion-free heat transport.</details> |

By incorporating four parameters, the scheme can reproduce classical fourth-order compact schemes and further extend to sixth- and eighth-order accurate formulations, all within a unified framework. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analyze the stability, convergence, and mass conservation of the parameterized numerical scheme. Numerical experiments are then conducted to examine the impact of parameter variations on errors, explore the relationship between parameters and the fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order schemes, and verify that the schemes' high-order accuracy aligns with theoretical predictions. To enhance the applicability of the proposed method, we further develop two fourth-order compact boundary treatments that ensure uniform accuracy between boundary and interior regions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes across various adsorption models.</details> |

Traditional methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1 second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind directions ( $0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections. The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

Cohen, Jackson Hebner, Deqing Jiang et.al. | [2507.06428](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06428) |  | 41 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We mathematically analyze and numerically study an actor-critic machine learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations from stochastic control theory. The architecture of the critic (the estimator for the value function) is structured so that the boundary condition is always perfectly satisfied (rather than being included in the training loss) and utilizes a biased gradient which reduces computational cost. The actor (the estimator for the optimal control) is trained by minimizing the integral of the Hamiltonian over the domain, where the Hamiltonian is estimated using the critic. We show that the training dynamics of the actor and critic neural networks converge in a Sobolev-type space to a certain infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units in the actor and critic $\rightarrow \infty$ . Further, under a convexity-like assumption on the Hamiltonian, we prove that any fixed point of this limit ODE is a solution of the original stochastic control problem. This provides an important guarantee for the algorithm's performance in light of the fact that finite-width neural networks may only converge to a local minimizers (and not optimal solutions) due to the non-convexity of their loss functions. In our numerical studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm can solve stochastic control problems accurately in up to 200 dimensions. In particular, we construct a series of increasingly complex stochastic control problems with known analytic solutions and study the algorithm's numerical performance on them. These problems range from a linear-quadratic regulator equation to highly challenging equations with non-convex Hamiltonians, allowing us to identify and analyze the strengths and limitations of this neural actor-critic method for solving HJB equations.</details> |

In the domain of wildland fire science, this challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i) identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel, ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.</details> |

Grundvig, Matthias Heinkenschloss et.al. | [2507.06199](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06199) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper develops a generalization of the line-search sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm with $\ell_1$-merit function that uses objective and constraint function approximations with tunable accuracy to solve smooth equality-constrained optimization problems. The evaluation of objective and constraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally expensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally inexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models can be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to satisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the algorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used to explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models are sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global convergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\ell_1$ -merit function, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model error bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control problem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions requires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE). The models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the Boussinesq PDE.</details> |

Duyen et.al. | [2507.06194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06194) |  | 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Journal of Applied   Physics | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.</details> |

One of the novelties of the method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed. Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the method. We observe numerical convergence as the size of the mesh tends to zero $h=1/N_h\searrow 0$ , with a better rate than two reference schemes.</details> |

Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</details> |

The method estimates Bayesian evidence using all generated samples from each proposal distribution while obtaining posterior samples through an importance-resampling scheme. A key innovation of SeMIS is the use of a softly truncated prior distribution as the intermediate proposal, providing a new way bridging prior and posterior distributions. By enabling samples from high-likelihood regions to traverse low-probability zones, SeMIS enhances mode mixing in challenging inference problems. Comparative evaluations against subset simulation (SuS) and adaptive Bayesian updating with structural reliability methods (aBUS) demonstrate that SeMIS achieves superior performance in evidence estimation (lower bias and variance) and posterior sampling (higher effective sample sizes and closer approximation to the true posterior), particularly for multimodal distributions. The efficacy of SeMIS is further validated in a high-dimensional finite element model updating application, where it successfully localizes structural damages by quantifying stiffness loss. The proposed algorithm not only advances Bayesian computation for complex posterior distributions but also provides a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in civil engineering systems, offering new possibilities for probabilistic structural health monitoring.</details> |

However, the computational cost of SFV method increases for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we incorporate interpolation-based reduced order modeling (ROM) techniques that reduce the cost of computing stochastic integrals in SFV method. Further efficiency gains are achieved through a Q-DEIM hyper-reduction method. Numerical experiments suggest that this approach can lower both computational cost and memory requirements for high-dimensional stochastic parameter spaces.</details> |

The bound seems to be stronger than earlier error bounds for cubic spline interpolation in such setting such as the not-a-knot spline. A brief analysis of the conditioning of the end conditions of cubic spline interpolation leads to a modification of the not-a-knot spline, and some numerical examples suggest that the interpolation error of this revised not-a-knot spline generally is comparable to the near optimal Q-spline and lower than for the not-a-knot spline when the mesh size is small.</details> |

A key element in their construction is the dilation sequence, which controls how the multipole consecutive scales are spaced and overlapped. At any resolution level, this sequence determines the center positions of the needlet weight functions and influences their localization in the spatial domain and spectral concentration properties by means of the relative bandwidth ratio. In this paper, we explore the different asymptotic regimes that arise when the dilation sequence exhibits shrinking, stable (standard), or spreading behavior. Moreover, we assume the dilation sequence grows regularly enough to ensure well-defined asymptotic properties. For each regime, we characterize the impact on the geometry of the center scales and the shape of the multipole windows, with particular attention to their overlap structure and spectral coverage. These insights help to clarify the trade-offs between localization, redundancy, and scalability in the design of needlet-type systems, particularly in relation to the study of the asymptotic uncorrelation of needlet coefficients when applied to random fields.</details> |

COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</details> |

Supplementary Information: 5 pages, 2   figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.</details> |

These spectral solvers exploit the fact that integration in the nonlocal formulation transforms into multiplication in Fourier space and that nonlocality is decoupled from the grid size. As a result, the computational cost is reduced to $O(N\log N)$ for an $N$ -point discretization grid. Our approach extends the spectral solvers developed by Alali and Albin (2020) for periodic domains by incorporating the two-dimensional Fourier continuation (2D-FC) algorithm introduced by Bruno and Paul (2022). We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on two-dimensional nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal diffusion equations defined on bounded domains. While the regularity of solutions to these equations in bounded settings remains an open problem, we conduct numerical experiments to explore this issue, particularly focusing on studying discontinuities.</details> |

New regularity results are proven for the stochastic heat equation. The spectral approximation is based on a truncation of the series expansion with respect to the spherical harmonic functions. To do so, we restrict to square-integrable random field and optimal strong convergence rates for a given regularity of the initial condition and two different settings of regularity for the driving noise are derived for the Euler-Maruyama methods. Besides strong convergence, convergence of the expectation and second moment is shown. Weak rates for the spectral approximation are discussed. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results.</details> |

Optimized schemes up to fourth-order of accuracy are derived and validated in terms of order of consistency, conservation of linear invariants, and entropy conservation/stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these P-ERRK methods when combined with a high-order, entropy-conservative/stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on unstructured meshes. The Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods(P-ERRK) are readily implemented for partitioned semidiscretizations arising from problems with equation-based scale separation such as non-uniform meshes. We highlight that the relaxation approach acts as a time-limiting technique which improves the nonlinear stability and thus robustness of the multirate schemes. The P-ERRK methods are applied to a range of problems, ranging from compressible Euler over compressible Navier-Stokes to the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in two and three spatial dimensions. For each test case, we compare computational load and runtime to standalone relaxed Runge-Kutta methods which are outperformed by factors up to four. All results can be reproduced using a publicly available repository.</details> |

A large timestep is desirable because simulations run fast. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that most simulations in the literature are indeed converged and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</details> |

This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</details> |

The nonlocal model is governed by a class of semi-linear partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs), in which the operator captures both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion effects, as revealed by its limiting behavior with respect to the interaction radius. To overcome the bottleneck of computational complexity caused by the curse of dimensionality and the dense linear systems arising from nonlocal operators, we propose a novel implicit-explicit scheme based on a direct approximation of the nonlinear Feynman-Kac representation. The incorporation of sparse grid interpolation significantly enhances the algorithm's scalability and enables its application to problems in high dimensions. To further address the challenges posed by hypersingular kernels, we design a sampling strategy tailored to their singular structure, which ensures accurate and stable treatment of the nonlocal operators within the probabilistic framework. Notably, the proposed method inherits unconditional stability from the underlying stochastic representation, without imposing constraints on the temporal and spatial discretization scales. A rigorous error analysis is provided to establish the convergence of the proposed scheme. Extensive numerical experiments, including some non-radial solutions in up to 100 dimensions, are presented to validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.</details> |

Drawing on concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the flow.</details> |

Anaya Morales et.al. | [2507.04892](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04892) |  | 16 pages, 5 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</details> |

We derive strong error bounds in terms of the underlying stepsize; the distance between the continuous terminal time and a discrete-time approximation; the distance between the terminal condition and a respective approximation; and an integrated distance depending on an approximation of the time component of the generator - all are scaled by the exponential of the maximal terminal time. As application we consider decoupled FBSDEs on bounded domains. We use an Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate the diffusion and further refine our error bounds to only depend on the distance of the exit times.</details> |

The core innovation lies in predicting and assigning the asymptotic limit value for each parameter during iterations based on its own historical data, rather than processing and assigning the entire flow field at once. This approach fundamentally guarantees identical results between serial and parallel computations. Subsequently, a formula for representing the asymptotic limit based on historical data is derived and discretized, yielding a purely algebraic expression.Furthermore, the applicability scope of the method is discussed, along with the underlying reasons for its acceleration capability. A quantitative expression for estimating the speedup ratio is also provided. Extensive validation cases were tested, ranging from the simplest inviscid airfoil flow to complex three-dimensional viscous transonic cruise flow around a aircraft, and solving asymmetric linear systems via GMRES. These tests consistently demonstrate significant acceleration effects with speedup factors ranging from 2.5 to 4. Combined with the near-zero computational overhead of the purely algebraic formulation during the solving process and the inherently parallel-compatible pointwise prediction principle, the results strongly indicate that this method is highly suitable for large-scale industrial mesh computations.</details> |

The three generations of left-handed lepton doublets are assumed to transform as the irreducible triplet $\bm{3_{0}}$ of $\Delta(96)$, and the two right-handed neutrinos are assigned to singlets. In the case that both flavon fields $\phi_{\text{atm}}$ and $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ transform as triplet $\bm{\bar{3}_{0}}$, only one phenomenologically viable lepton mixing pattern is obtained for normal ordering neutrino masses. The lepton mixing matrix is predicted to be TM1 pattern, with neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP violation phases depending on only three real input parameters. When $\phi_{\text{sol}}$ is assigned to the $\bm{\bar{3}_{1}}$ representation, an additional real parameter $x$ must be included. Then we find 42 independent phenomenologically interesting mixing patterns, and the corresponding predictions for lepton mixing parameters and neutrino masses are obtained. Furthermore, we perform a detailed numerical analysis for five example breaking patterns with some benchmark values of $x$. The absolute values of the first columns of PMNS matrix are fixed to be $\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{5}\left(\sqrt{17},2,2\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{38}}\left(5,2,3\right)^{T}$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{57}}\left(\sqrt{37},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{10}\right)^{T}$ and $\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt{6},1,\sqrt{2}\right)^{T}$ , respectively.</details> |

We focus on the recovery of an unknown spatial source function in a multi-dimensional TSFDE, incorporating Caputo time-fractional derivatives and the fractional Laplacian. The inherent ill-posedness is addressed via a quasi-boundary value regularization, followed by a finite difference discretization that leads to large, structured linear systems. We develop and analyze a block triangular preconditioning strategy that mimics the coefficient matrix, while simplifying its structure for computational efficiency. Numerical experiments using the GMRES solver demonstrate that the proposed preconditioner significantly improve convergence rates, robustness, and accuracy, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-world inverse problems involving fractional modeling.</details> |

While controlling the error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the time step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has been observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes -- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size independent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of observables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error bounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies solely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the continuous and discrete settings. Unlike previous analyses, it avoids Egorov-type theorems and bypasses heavy semiclassical machinery. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds for Trotterization in the semiclassical regime that relies only on algebraic structure, without invoking the semiclassical limit.</details> |

Comments are Welcome | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</details> |

The method is constructed on local anisotropic mixed meshes, which are generated by fitting the interface through simple connection of intersection points on an interface-unfitted background mesh, as introduced in \cite{Hu2021optimal}. For triangular elements, we employ the standard $\mathcal{CR}$ element; for quadrilateral elements, a new rotated $Q_1$-type element is used. We prove that this rotated $Q_1$ element remains unisolvent and stable even on degenerate quadrilateral elements. Based on these properties, we further show that the space pair of $\mathcal{CR}$-rotated $Q_1$ elements (for velocity) and piecewise $P_0$ spaces (for pressure) satisfies the inf-sup condition without requiring any stabilization terms. As established in our previous work \cite{Wang2025nonconforming}, the consistency error achieves the optimal convergence order without the need for penalty terms to control it. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to verify our theoretical results.</details> |

Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</details> |

Bebendorf et.al. | [2507.02655](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02655) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Many elliptic boundary value problems exhibit an interior regularity property, which can be exploited to construct local approximation spaces that converge exponentially within function spaces satisfying this property. These spaces can be used to define local ansatz spaces within the framework of generalised finite element methods, leading to a better relation between dimensionality and convergence order. In this paper, we present a new technique for the construction of such spaces for Lipschitz domains. Instead of the commonly used approach based on eigenvalue problems it relies on extensions of approximations performed on the boundary. Hence, it improves the influence of the spatial dimension on the exponential convergence and allows to construct the local spaces by solving the original kind of variational problems on easily structured domains.</details> |

It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</details> |

Abueidda, Mbebo Nonna, Panos Pantidis et.al. | [2507.02524](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02524) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Accurately learning solution operators for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) from sparse and irregular data remains a challenging task. Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation. Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in transient mechanics.</details> |

In this regime, the time step can be subject to stability constraints related to the smallness of Larmor radius and plasma frequency [21]. To avoid this limitation, our approach is based on numerical schemes [9, 10, 12], providing a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center system taking into account variations of the magnetic field.

This problem can be approached from two well-established points of view: deterministically using regularisation methods, or stochastically using the Bayesian framework. Both approaches frequently require the solution of a variational problem. In the paper we elaborate the connection between these approaches by establishing the equivalence between a smoothing Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance operators and Sobolev embedding operator $E_s: H^s \hookrightarrow L^2$. We further discuss the use of a Wavelet-based implementation of the adjoint operator $E_s^*$ which also allows for efficient evaluations for certain Mat{\'e}rn covariance operators, leading to efficient implementations both in terms of computational effort as well as memory requirements. The proposed methods are validated with reconstructions for the photoacoustic problem.</details> |

We follow the characteristics-based approach by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023asymptotic} to get a reformulated model, which couples a low dimension convection-diffusion-type equation for macroscopic quantities with a high dimension transport equation for the radiative intensity.   To recover the correct free streaming limit due to frequency-dependency, we propose a correction to the reformulated macroscopic equation.   The macroscopic system is solved using a hybrid method:   convective fluxes are handled by a particle-based MC method, while diffusive fluxes are treated implicitly with central difference.   To address the nonlinear coupling between radiative intensity and the Planck function across multiple frequency groups, we adopt a Picard iteration with a predictor-corrector procedure, which decouples a global nonlinear system into a linear system restricted to spatial dimension (independent of frequency) with scalar algebraic nonlinear equations.   Once the macroscopic update is done, the transport equation, with a known emission source provided by the macroscopic variables, is efficiently solved using an implicit MC method. This approach enables larger time steps independent of the speed of light and also the frequency across a wide range, significantly enhancing computational efficiency, especially for frequency-dependent RTEs.   Formal AP analysis in the diffusive scaling is established. Numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the high efficiency and AP property of the proposed method.</details> |

First, we propose an equivalent formulation of the equations by introducing an auxiliary variable. Then, we discretize the space variables using HDG methods, resulting in a semi-discrete scheme that preserves a discrete version of the Hamiltonian structure. The use of an alternative formulation with the auxiliary variable is crucial for developing the HDG scheme that preserves this Hamiltonian structure. The resulting system is subsequently discretized in time using symplectic integrators, ensuring the energy conservation of the fully discrete scheme. We present numerical experiments that demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all variables and showcase the conservation of total energy, as well as the evolution of other physical quantities.</details> |

The surrogate architecture transforms unstructured computational meshes into node-element hypergraphs that encode higher-order spatial relationships through element-based connectivity, preserving the geometric and topological structure of the underlying finite-element discretization. The temporal evolution of the fluid-structure interaction is modeled via a modular partitioned architecture: a complex-valued, proper orthogonal decomposition-based sub-network predicts mesh deformation using a low-rank representation of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) grid displacements, while a hypergraph-based message-passing network predicts the unsteady flow field using geometry-aware node, element, and hybrid edge features. High-fidelity ALE-based simulations provide training and evaluation data across a range of Reynolds numbers and reduced velocities for isolated and tandem cylinder configurations. The framework demonstrates stable roll-outs and accurately captures the nonlinear variation of oscillation amplitudes with respect to reduced velocity, a key challenge in surrogate modeling of flow-induced vibrations. In the tandem configuration, the model successfully resolves complex wake-body interactions and multi-scale coupling effects, enabling accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fields under strong wake interference conditions. Our results show high fidelity in reproducing force statistics, dominant frequencies, and flow-field dynamics, supporting the framework's potential as a robust surrogate model for digital twin applications.</details> |

Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification, leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem in computational finance.</details> |
| 2025-06-30 | Modified non-local damage model: resolving spurious damage evolution | Roshan Philip Saji, Panos Pantidis, Mostafa E. Mobasher et.al. | [2506.24099](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24099) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Accurate prediction of damage and fracture evolution is critical for the safety design and preventive maintenance of engineering structures, however existing computational methods face significant limitations. On one hand, discrete damage and phase-field models are often computationally prohibitive for real world applications and they are less generalizable across different material classes. On the other hand, conventional gradient damage models which are based on phenomenological laws, though more computationally efficient, they suffer from unrealistic widening of the damage-band as damage progresses. This paper presents a modified non-local gradient damage model (MNLD) that overcomes these shortcomings by introducing modifications to the stress degradation function and forcing term in the Helmholtz free energy expression. These two modifications ensure that as damage approaches its maximum value, both the thermodynamic damage driving force for damage vanishes and the evolution of the forcing term decays. Consequently, the damage band retains a non-growing constant width throughout its evolution. The proposed approach builds on insights gained from two intermediate models, which addressed the necessary conditions separately before integrating them into a unified formulation. Numerical validation is performed on several 1D and 2D benchmark problems, demonstrating that the proposed model can reliably produce fixed-width damage bands. The proposed approach can be implemented within existing gradient damage-based finite element frameworks with minimal implementation changes. The results highlight the potential of this approach to resolve the decades-long challenge of spurious widening in gradient damage models, offering an effective and practical solution for engineering applications.</details> |

Using the recently computed next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the SIDIS cross section together with known results for the form factor and splitting functions in QCD up to four loops, we derive the complete soft and collinear contributions to the SIDIS coefficient functions at four-loop order. We also include systematically the next-to-leading power corrections, which are suppressed near threshold. The numerical analysis of the new four-loop corrections shows a small effect on the cross section underpinning the very good perturbative stability of the SIDIS process at that order in perturbation theory, including the reduced dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ .</details> |

Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of   $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$   score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K$ is an arbitrarily large fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE.</details> |

CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</details> |

The main challenge in the construction and analysis of time-discrete numerical schemes is caused by a drift that blows up at the origin, highly nonlinear drift and diffusion coefficients and positivity-preserving requirement. Due to the presence of the Poisson jumps, additional difficulties arise in recovering the exact order $1/2$ of convergence for the time-stepping schemes. By incorporating implicitness in the term $\alpha_{-1}x^{-1} $ and introducing the modifications functions $f_h$ and $g_h$ in the recursion, a novel explicit Euler-type scheme is proposed, which is easy to implement and preserves the positivity of the original model unconditionally, i.e., for any time step-size $h>0$. A mean-square convergence rate of order $1/2$ is established for the proposed scheme in both the non-critical and general critical cases. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</details> |

| 2025-06-30 | A hybrid numerical algorithm based on the stochastic particle Shakhov and DSMC method | Hao Jin, Sha Liu, Sirui Yang et.al. | [2506.23917](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23917) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is widely employed for simulating rarefied nonequilibrium gas flows. With advances in aerospace engineering and micro/nano-scale technologies, gas flows exhibit the coexistence of rarefied and continuum/near-continuum regimes, which calls for larger time steps and coarser spatial grids for efficient numerical simulation. However, the mesh sizes and time steps in DSMC are constrained by the single-scale nature of the Boltzmann equation and the explicit treatment of collision term following operator splitting. To overcome the resulting computational inefficiency, the Time-Relaxed Monte Carlo (TRMC) method introduces a suitable time discretization of the Boltzmann equation, allowing for significantly larger time steps. Besides, domain decomposition methods leverage the complementary strengths of continuum and particle-based approaches, facilitating the efficient simulation of multi-scale gas flows. However, in TRMC method, the physically accurate high-order terms are truncated and approximated through convergence to a local Maxwellian distribution. Meanwhile, the continuum breakdown criteria employed in hybrid methods are either empirical or semi-empirical. Recently, a timescale-based decomposition of the Boltzmann equation has been proposed to enable a more rational coupling between DSMC and Navier-Stokes. Inspired by this strategy, a novel hybrid particle method is proposed to couple the stochastic particle Shakhov with DSMC, in which the collision operator is decomposed into two sub-steps based on local observation timescale and the relaxation time. The validity and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through a series of benchmark cases, including 1-D sod shock tube, 2-D hypersonic flow around cylinder and jet expansion into the vacuum, 3-D hypersonic flows around sphere and X-38 like vehicle in near-continuum flow regimes.</details> |

Southworth et.al. | [2506.23914](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23914) |  | 24 pages, 21 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from experimental radiographic images.</details> |
| 2025-06-30 | Dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances | Josie König, Elizabeth Qian, Melina A. Freitag et.al. | [2506.23892](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23892) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</details> |

In this review, we explore how Ising and Ising-like models have been successfully adapted to sociophysical systems, where binary-state agents mimic human decisions or opinions. By focusing on key areas such as opinion dynamics, financial markets, social segregation, game theory, language evolution, and epidemic spreading, we demonstrate how the models describing these phenomena, inspired by the Ising model, capture essential features of collective behavior, including phase transitions, consensus formation, criticality, and metastability. In particular, we emphasize the role of the dynamical rules of evolution in the different models that often converge back to Ising-like universality. We end by outlining the future directions in sociphysics research, highlighting the continued relevance of the Ising model in the analysis of complex social systems.</details> |

Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.</details> |

For discretization of this problem we apply a $H^1$ -conforming finite element method in space combined with a semi-implicit Euler time stepping. The semi-implicit Euler method results in a linear problem in each time step. We restrict to the regime of smooth solutions of the continuous problem and present an error analysis of this discretization method. This results in optimal order discretization error bounds. Key ingredients of the analysis are a discrete energy estimate, that mimics the energy dissipation of the continuous solution, and a convexity property that is essential for discrete stability and for control of the linearization error. We also present numerical results that validate the theoretical ones.</details> |

Taylor et.al. | [2506.23741](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23741) |  | 15 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Finite element methods usually construct basis functions and quadrature rules for multidimensional domains via tensor products of one-dimensional counterparts. While straightforward, this approach results in integration spaces larger than necessary, especially as the polynomial degree $p$ or the spatial dimension increases, leading to considerable computational overhead. This work starts from the hypothesis that reducing the dimensionality of the polynomial space can lead to quadrature rules with fewer points and lower computational cost, while preserving the exactness of numerical integration. We use trunk spaces that exclude high-degree monomials that do not improve the approximation quality of the discrete space. These reduced spaces retain sufficient expressive power and allow us to construct smaller (more economical) integration domains. Given a maximum degree $p$, we define trial and test spaces $U$ and $V$ as 2D or 3D trunk spaces and form the integration space $\mathcal{S} = U \otimes V$. We then construct exact quadrature rules by solving a non-convex optimisation problem over the number of points $q$, their coordinates, and weights. We use a shallow neural network with linear activations to parametrise the rule, and a random restart strategy to mitigate convergence to poor local minima. When necessary, we dynamically increase $q$ to achieve exact integration. Our construction reaches machine-precision accuracy (errors below 1e-22) using significantly fewer points than standard tensor-product Gaussian quadrature: up to 30\% reduction in 2D for $p \leq 10$, and 50\% in 3D for $p \leq 6$ . These results show that combining the mathematical understanding of polynomial structure with numerical optimisation can lead to a practical and extensible methodology for improving the adaptiveness, efficiency, and scalability of quadrature rules for high-order finite element simulations.</details> |

We establish progressively stronger convergence results, ranging from basic sequence convergence to precise convergence rates, under a hierarchy of assumptions. In particular, we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the sequences of iterates generated by ALMs converge to solutions of the ``closest feasible problem''.   This study leverages the classical relationship between ALMs and the proximal-point algorithm applied to the dual problem. A key technical contribution is a set of concise results on the behavior of the proximal-point algorithm when applied to functions that may not have minimizers.

Conversely, utilizing non-conservative forms often introduces significant errors near these discontinuities or results in smeared shocks. This dependency poses a considerable limitation, particularly as many PDEs encountered in complex physical phenomena, such as multi-phase flows, are inherently non-conservative. This inherent non-conservativity restricts the direct applicability of standard numerical solvers designed for conservative forms. This work aims to thoroughly investigate the sensitivity of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the choice of PDE formulation (conservative vs. non-conservative) when solving problems involving shocks and discontinuities. We have conducted this investigation across a range of benchmark problems, specifically the Burgers equation and both steady and unsteady Euler equations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of PINNs capabilities in this critical area.</details> |

Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</details> |

With the rise of quantum computing, new approaches have emerged to address these challenges. In this work, we investigate the potential of quantum algorithms for solving the shallow water equations, which are, for example, used to model tsunami dynamics. By extending a linearization scheme previously developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 013036 (2025)] for the Navier-Stokes equations, we create a mapping from the nonlinear shallow water equation to a linear system of equations, which, in principle, can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum device than on a classical computer. To validate our approach, we compare its results to an analytical solution and benchmark its dependence on key parameters. Additionally, we implement a quantum linear system solver based on quantum singular value transformation and study its performance in connection to our mapping. Our results demonstrate the potential of applying quantum algorithms to fluid dynamics problems and highlight necessary considerations for future developments.</details> |

A convergence theorem is established for evaluating ADC, along with a sharp upper bound and the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving this bound. These results provide the first theoretical justification for the optimal thermal conductivity of triply periodic minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we show that ADC yields a third-order approximation to the effective conductivity of shell lattices at low volume fractions. To support practical design applications, we develop a discrete algorithm for computing and optimizing ADC over arbitrary periodic surfaces. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.</details> |

Recent innovations in AFD-WENO methods allow us to treat hyperbolic system with non-conservative products almost as efficiently as conservation laws. However, some PDE systems,like computational electrodynamics (CED) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), have involution constraints that require divergence-free or divergence-preserving evolution of vector fields. In such situations, a Yee-style collocation of variables proves indispensable; and that collocation is retained in this work. In previous works, only higher order finite volume discretization of such involution constrained systems was possible. In this work, we show that substantially more efficient AFD-WENO methods have been extended to encompass divergence-preserving hyperbolic PDEs.   Our method retains the Yee-style collocation of normal components of...</details> |

We decompose the adjacency tensor of such networks into two components: a low-rank signal tensor that captures the essential network structure and a zero-mean noise tensor that accounts for random variations. Building on recent advancements in tensor decomposition and random tensor theory, we introduce a generalized denoise-and-solve framework that leverages the Einstein summation convention for efficient tensor operations. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity while demonstrating strong performance in network inference tasks, providing a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing large-scale, multi-dimensional networks.</details> |

First, we present a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a single curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we detail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for numerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's problem are found.</details> |

It is used to determine evaporation coefficients of fluids under high-pressure conditions, a critical factor for efficient fuel mixing in internal combustion engines. The solver handles collisions for different fluid species separately, thereby accurately capturing species-specific interactions essential for realistic evaporation modeling. A new pair correlation function based on the BMCSL equation of state is employed to enhance modeling accuracy, though compliance with Onsager relations remains to be explored.   Validation through various numerical simulations demonstrates the solver's capability. Results from binary fluid relaxation simulations closely match molecular dynamics (MD) data, highlighting accurate collision frequency modeling. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art models verify the solver's precision in predicting liquid-vapor equilibria and evaporation coefficients across diverse pressure scenarios.   Detailed simulations of argon-neon mixtures with realistic particle diameters and masses underscore the significant improvements achieved by employing this multi-species approach over traditional single-species methods. Comparisons with the SAFT-VRQ Mie and classical density functional theory confirm the solver's reliability in predicting liquid and vapor compositions and detailed density profiles at interfaces over a wide range of pressures and temperatures.   Further analyses illustrate complex dependencies of evaporation and condensation coefficients on temperature and pressure, consistent with existing research findings. Overall, this work advances computational modeling of multi-species evaporation processes in high-pressure environments at different temperatures, providing essential data for improved combustion modeling and broader applications in multi-phase fluid dynamics.</details> |

Guided by the de Rham complex, we develop conditions under which schemes deliver locking-free, optimal rates of convergence. We naturally recover the typical assumptions arising for clamped, simply supported plates. More importantly, we also see new conditions arise naturally from the presence of holes in the domain or in the case of mixed boundary conditions. We show that, fortunately, many of the existing popularly used schemes do, in fact, satisfy all of the conditions, and thus are locking-free.</details> |

Numerical analysis is established by combining a continuous reformulation of the numerical scheme, the Bourgain-space estimates for the continuous reformulation, and a rescaling strategy that reduces the reformulated problem to a small initial value problem, which allow us to bridge a critical gap between numerical analysis and theoretical well-posedness by designing the first numerical method capable of solving the KdV equation in the negative Sobolev spaces. The numerical scheme is proved to have nearly optimal-order convergence with respect to the spatial degrees of freedom in the $H^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ norm for initial data in $H^s$, with $-\frac{1}{2} < s \leq 0$ , a result unattainable by existing numerical methods.</details> |

While the number of available U-MLIPs and their fine-tuning applications is rapidly expanding, there remains a lack of systematic guidance on how to effectively fine-tune these models. This tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to fine-tuning U-MLIPs for computational materials modeling. Using the recently released MACE-MP-0 as a representative example, we cover key aspects of the fine-tuning process, including dataset preparation, hyperparameter selection, model training, and validation. The effectiveness of fine-tuning is demonstrated through case studies involving force prediction in solid-state electrolytes, stacking fault defects in metals, and solid--liquid interfacial interactions in low-dimensional systems. To support practical applications, we include code examples that enable researchers, particularly those new to the field, to efficiently incorporate fine-tuned U-MLIPs into their workflows.</details> |

However, the current multigrid library still needs more satisfactory performance for structured grid problems regarding speed and scalability. Based on the classical 'multigrid seesaw', we derive three necessary principles for an efficient structured multigrid, which instructs our design and implementation of StructMG, a fast and scalable algebraic multigrid that constructs hierarchical grids automatically. As a preconditioner, StructMG can achieve both low cost per iteration and good convergence when solving large-scale linear systems with iterative methods in parallel. A stencil-based triple-matrix product via symbolic derivation and code generation is proposed for multi-dimensional Galerkin coarsening to reduce grid complexity, operator complexity, and implementation effort. A unified parallel framework of sparse triangular solver is presented to achieve fast convergence and high parallel efficiency for smoothers, including dependence-preserving Gauss-Seidel and incomplete LU methods. Idealized and real-world problems from radiation hydrodynamics, petroleum reservoir simulation, numerical weather prediction, and solid mechanics, are evaluated on ARM and X86 platforms to show StructMG's effectiveness. In comparison to \textit{hypre}'s structured and general multigrid preconditioners, StructMG achieves the fastest time-to-solutions in all cases with average speedups of 15.5x, 5.5x, 6.7x, 7.3x over SMG, PFMG, SysPFMG, and BoomerAMG, respectively. StructMG also significantly improves strong and weak scaling efficiencies.</details> |

Jorge et.al. | [2506.21888](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21888) |  | 23 pages, 21 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A new numerical method is developed to approximate the solution of Laplace's equation in the exterior of the sphere with a strongly nonlinear boundary value of oblique type. A functional analysis attempt to solve this type of boundary condition is not straight forward since results about existence and uniqueness of solution are still limited. Hence, a semi analytical method is described here to approach a solution. A perturbation solution around the monopole converts the nonlinear oblique problem into a series of known Neumann problems in the exterior of the sphere. The corresponding Green's function representation for the exterior Neumann problem gives an exact analytic solution for each perturbation step as an integral on the surface of the sphere. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions become very complicated and require to be approximated numerically. The perturbation solutions given by integrals of the Green's function on the sphere are computed at each perturbation step using different subdivisions of the surface integrals with the help of adaptive quadrature method. We call icosahedron method to the integration on the sphere with an icosahedron mesh using Gauss 5-point or adaptive quadrature, according to the integration parameter. This method was very effective to deal with the singularity of the Green's function successfully avoiding inaccuracies on the numerical approximation and is an important contribution of this work. The numerical perturbation scheme is performed for two given exact solutions. The icosahedron method is found to be very precise. The approximations show the desired properties: they get closer to the exact solutions as the perturbation parameter gets smaller, show rapid convergence in the exterior of the unit sphere and converge to zero as the radius grows.</details> |

In this paper, guided by the general equation for nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework, a novel GENERIC-guided active learning smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$) method is proposed to obtain effective constitutive relations for reliable simulations of viscoelastic flows. By utilizing the GENERIC framework, the target viscoelastic constitutive relation is reduced to a simple functional relation between the eigenvalues of the conformation tensor and the eigenvalues of its thermodynamically conjugated tensorial variable, which incorporates the flow-history-dependent memory effect. Based on data and Gaussian process regression (GPR), a new active learning strategy is developed to obtain the simplified constitutive relation, in which the generalization ability is ensured by actively acquiring more data points when needed. Moreover, a novel relative uncertainty is devised to establish an accuracy evaluation tool for the GPR prediction results, which reduces the number of required training data points while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, the SPH method combined with the latest techniques serves as an effective macroscopic numerical method. Eventually, the Poiseuille flows and the flows around a periodic array of cylinders at different Weissenberg numbers are simulated to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method. The Oldroyd-B model is used as the ground truth constitutive relation to provide data for GPR, bringing analytical solutions for comparison. The excellent performance demonstrates that the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method has promising applications in data-driven simulations of viscoelastic fluids.</details> |

Fully characterizing a quantum channel generally requires preparing a complete set of input states, such as a basis for the state space, and measuring the corresponding output states. In this work, we begin by investigating a single input-output pair using projected gradient dynamics. This approach applies optimization flows constrained to the Stiefel manifold and the probabilistic simplex to identify the original quantum channel. The convergence of the flow is guaranteed by its relationship to the Zariski topology. We present numerical investigations of models adapted to various scenarios, including those with multiple input-output pairs, highlighting the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</details> |

Zimoń, Fausto Martelli et.al. | [2506.21821](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21821) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Thermodynamics, introduced over two centuries ago, remains foundational to our understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering systems. Its principles are traditionally grounded in the statistical mechanics framework, which explains macroscopic behavior from microscopic states. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that interprets thermodynamic behavior through the lenses of time series analysis, an approach commonly used in other fields, including finance, climate, and signal processing. We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, the most complex, anomalous, and important substance known, over a wide range of its phase diagram. By examining the temporal evolution of the hydrogen bond network (HBN) topology, we demonstrate that the dynamics of microscopic topological motifs populating the HBN encode the system's macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, our approach enables the prediction of thermodynamic properties in regions beyond those directly sampled in our simulations. We achieve this result by leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in temporally resolved data that are often lost through conventional averaging. This work offers new insights into the fundamental behavior of water and network-forming materials more broadly, establishing a new paradigm for understanding material properties beyond the classical confines of statistical mechanics.</details> |

Nguyen et.al. | [2506.21699](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21699) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper addresses the challenging and interesting inverse problem of reconstructing the spatially varying dielectric constant of a medium from phaseless backscattering measurements generated by single-point illumination. The underlying mathematical model is governed by the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation, and the available data consist solely of the magnitude of the scattered wave field. To address the nonlinearity and severe ill-posedness of this phaseless inverse scattering problem, we introduce a robust, globally convergent numerical framework combining several key regularization strategies. Our method first employs a phase retrieval step based on the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) ansatz, where the lost phase information is reconstructed by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, we implement a Fourier-based dimension reduction technique, transforming the original problem into a more stable system of elliptic equations with Cauchy boundary conditions. To solve this resulting system reliably, we apply the Carleman convexification approach, constructing a strictly convex weighted cost functional whose global minimizer provides an accurate approximation of the true solution. Numerical simulations using synthetic data with high noise levels demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, confirming its capability to accurately recover both the geometric location and contrast of hidden scatterers.</details> |

High computational costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization, with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware dependency.</details> |

Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</details> |

However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave.

We first work through the PDE constrained optimization procedure in a continuous setting and derive the adjoint equations using a Lagrangian reformulation. For the scattering coefficient, a periodic B-spline approximation is introduced and a gradient descent step for updating its coefficients is formulated. After the discretization, a dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) is applied. We make use of the rank-adaptive basis update & Galerkin integrator and a line search approach for the adaptive refinement of the gradient descent step size and the DLRA tolerance. We show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces both memory and computational cost. Numerical results computed with different initial conditions validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DLRA scheme compared to solutions computed with a full solver.</details> |

Building on the concept of an optimal projector defined via the symmetric part of the governing operator, we generalise the formulation to treat the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The arroach maintains a clear separation between the resolved and unresolved scales, with the fine-scale contributions approximated through the approximate Fine-Scale Greens' function of the associated symmetric operator. This enables a consistent variational treatment of the nonlinearity while preserving high-order accuracy. We show that the method yields numerical solutions that closely approximate the optimal projection of the continuous/highly resolved solution and inherits desirable conservation properties. Numerical results confirm the framework's robustness, accuracy, and its potential for application to a broad class of nonlinear multiscale problems.</details> |

Their full discretization results in a large-scale saddle-point system at each time step that is becoming singular for locking cases and needs effective preconditioners for its fast iterative solution. Instead of constructing spectrally equivalent ones, we develop nonsingular preconditioners so that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system consist of a cluster around $1$ and an outlier in the order of $1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a Lam\'{e} constant that is large for locking cases. It is known that the convergence factor of GMRES is bounded by the radius of the cluster for this type of systems. Both two- and three-field block triangular Schur complement preconditioners are studied. Upper bounds of the radius of the eigenvalue cluster for those systems are obtained and shown to be related to the inf-sup condition but independent of mesh size, time step, and locking parameters, which reflects the robustness of the preconditioners with respect to parameter variations. Moreover, the developed preconditioners do not need to compute the Schur complement and neither require exact inversion of diagonal blocks except the leading one. A locking-free weak Galerkin finite element method and the implicit Euler scheme are used for the discretization of the governing equation. Both two- and three-dimensional numerical results are presented to confirm the effectiveness and parameter-robustness of the developed preconditioners.</details> |

Our work is motivated by applications to the study of the stopping power of $\alpha$ particles at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). In this regime, electrons are in a warm dense state, requiring more than a standard kinetic model. They are hot enough to neglect Pauli exclusion, yet quantum enough to require accounting for uncertainty. The Wigner-Poisson system captures these effects but presents challenges due to its nonlocal nature. Based on a second-order Strang splitting method, we first design a full-rank solver with a structure-preserving Fourier update that ensures the intermediate solutions remain real-valued (up to machine precision), improving upon previous methods. Simulations demonstrate that the solutions exhibit a low rank structure for moderate to high dimensionless Planck constants ($H \ge 0.1$). This observed low rank structure motivates the development of an adaptive-rank solver, built on a Semi-Lagrangian adaptive-rank (SLAR) scheme for advection and an adaptive-rank, structure-preserving Fourier update for the Wigner integral terms, with a rigorous proof of structure-preserving property provided. Our solver achieves $O(N)$ complexity in both storage and computation time, while preserving mass and maintaining momentum accuracy up to the truncation error. The adaptive rank simulations are visually indistinguishable from the full-rank simulations in capturing solution structures. These results highlight the potential of adaptive rank methods for high-dimensional Wigner-Poisson simulations, paving the way toward fully kinetic studies of stopping power in warm dense plasmas.</details> |

These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</details> |

The gCQ generalizes Lubich's original convolution quadrature (CQ) to variable steps. High-order versions of the gCQ have been developed in the last decade, relying on certain Runge--Kutta methods. The Runge--Kutta based gCQ has been studied so far in a rather general setting, which includes applications to boundary integral formulations of wave problems. The available stability and convergence results for these new methods are suboptimal compared to those known for the uniform-step CQ, both in terms of convergence order and regularity requirements of the data. Here we focus on a special class of sectorial problems and prove that in these important applications it is possible to achieve the same order of convergence as for the original CQ, under the same regularity hypotheses on the data, and for very general time meshes. In the particular case of data with some known algebraic type of singularity, we also show how to choose an optimally graded time mesh to achieve convergence with maximal order, overcoming the well-known order reduction of the original CQ in these situations. An important advantage of the gCQ method is that it allows for a fast and memory-efficient implementation. We describe how the fast and oblivious Runge--Kutta based gCQ can be implemented and illustrate our theoretical results with several numerical experiments.

Takács, Tamás Fülöp et.al. | [2506.21241](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21241) |  | 24 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Symplectic numerical methods have become a widely-used choice for the accurate simulation of Hamiltonian systems in various fields, including celestial mechanics, molecular dynamics and robotics. Even though their characteristics are well-understood mathematically, relatively little attention has been paid in general to the practical aspect of how the choice of coordinates affects the accuracy of the numerical results, even though the consequences can be computationally significant. The present article aims to fill this gap by giving a systematic overview of how coordinate transformations can influence the results of simulations performed using symplectic methods. We give a derivation for the non-invariance of the modified Hamiltonian of symplectic methods under coordinate transformations, as well as a sufficient condition for the non-preservation of a first integral corresponding to a cyclic coordinate for the symplectic Euler method. We also consider the possibility of finding order-compensating coordinate transformations that improve the order of accuracy of a numerical method. Various numerical examples are presented throughout.</details> |

Neher, Erik Faulhaber, Sven Berger et.al. | [2506.21206](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21206) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Obtaining high-quality particle distributions for stable and accurate particle-based simulations poses significant challenges, especially for complex geometries. We introduce a preprocessing technique for 2D and 3D geometries, optimized for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and other particle-based methods. Our pipeline begins with the generation of a resolution-adaptive point cloud near the geometry's surface employing a face-based neighborhood search. This point cloud forms the basis for a signed distance field, enabling efficient, localized computations near surface regions. To create an initial particle configuration, we apply a hierarchical winding number method for fast and accurate inside-outside segmentation. Particle positions are then relaxed using an SPH-inspired scheme, which also serves to pack boundary particles. This ensures full kernel support and promotes isotropic distributions while preserving the geometry interface. By leveraging the meshless nature of particle-based methods, our approach does not require connectivity information and is thus straightforward to integrate into existing particle-based frameworks. It is robust to imperfect input geometries and memory-efficient without compromising performance. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that with increasingly higher resolution, the resulting particle distribution converges to the exact geometry.</details> |

When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.</details> |

Rumiantsev, Andrei Zaitsevskii et.al. | [2506.21133](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21133) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>An efficiency of the Tucker decomposition of amplitude tensors within the single-reference relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (RCCSD) was studied in a series of benchmark calculations for (AuCl) $_n$ chains, Au$_n$ clusters, and the cluster model of solid YbCl$_2$. The 1 kJ/mol level of accuracy for correlation energy estimates of moderate-size systems and typical reaction energies can be achieved with relatively high compression rates of amplitude tensors via rejecting singular values smaller than $\sim 10^{-4}$. For the most extensive system studied (YbCl$_7$ cluster used for modeling of ytterbium center in ytterbium dichloride crystal), only $\sim 3$ % of compressed doubles amplitudes were shown to be significant. Thus, the rank reduction for the relativistic CCSD theory improving its computational scaling is feasible. The advantage (if not necessity) of using the Goldstone diagrammatic technique rather than the "antisymmetrized" Brandow one is underlined. The proposed approach is promising for high-precision modeling of relatively large systems with heavy atoms.</details> |

Schiano Di Cola et.al. | [2506.21124](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21124) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.</details> |

Accurately capturing the macroscopic behavior of such systems poses significant computational challenges due to the dynamic fine-scale geometries. In this paper, we develop a robust and generalizable multiscale modeling framework based on multicontinuum homogenization to derive effective macroscopic equations in shrinking domains. The method distinguishes multiple continua according to the physical characteristics (e.g., channel widths), and couples them via space-time local cell problems formulated on representative volume elements. These local problems incorporate temporal derivatives and domain evolution, ensuring consistency with underlying fine-scale dynamics. The resulting upscaled system yields computable macroscopic coefficients and is suitable for large-scale simulations. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and potential applicability of the method to complex time-dependent engineering problems.</details> |

The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O $_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.</details> |

Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty, rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$ ($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$. Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an $\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an $\epsilon$ -SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.</details> |

PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.</details> |

They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</details> |

HPSTM leverages the linearity-preserving properties of the Sumudu transform and the flexibility of homotopy perturbation, achieving faster convergence than Laplace-HPM or Elzaki-HPM for strongly nonlinear FPDEs. Series solutions yield absolute errors as low as $3.12 \times 10^{-3}$ for $\alpha = 0.9$, with computational times averaging 0.5 seconds per example using 5 series terms on standard hardware. Solutions are validated against exact solutions, Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM), radial basis function (RBF) meshless method, Variational Iteration Method (VIM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), and a spectral method. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations for $\alpha = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7$ confirm HPSTM's accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Limitations include challenges with high-order nonlinearities and multi-dimensional domains. HPSTM shows promise for applications in modeling fluid flow in porous media, heat conduction in complex materials, and biological population dynamics.</details> |

While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.</details> |
| 2025-06-25 | A Taylor-Hood finite element method for the surface Stokes problem without penalization | Alan Demlow, Michael Neilan et.al. | [2506.20419](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20419) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Finite element approximation of the velocity-pressure formulation of the surfaces Stokes equations is challenging because it is typically not possible to enforce both tangentiality and $H^1$ conformity of the velocity field. Most previous works concerning finite element methods (FEMs) for these equations thus have weakly enforced one of these two constraints by penalization or a Lagrange multiplier formulation. Recently in [A tangential and penalty-free finite element method for the surface Stokes problem, SINUM 62(1):248-272, 2024], the authors constructed a surface Stokes FEM based on the MINI element which is tangentiality conforming and $H^1$ nonconforming, but possesses sufficient weak continuity properties to circumvent the need for penalization. The key to this method is construction of velocity degrees of freedom lying on element edges and vertices using an auxiliary Piola transform. In this work we extend this methodology to construct Taylor-Hood surface FEMs. The resulting method is shown to achieve optimal-order convergence when the edge degrees of freedom for the velocity spaced are placed at Gauss-Lobatto nodes. Numerical experiments confirm that this nonstandard placement of nodes is necessary to achieve optimal convergence orders.</details> |

The objective is to determine the positions of external dampers in such a way that the influence of the input on the output is minimized. The energy response serves as an optimization criterion, whose computation involves solving Lyapunov equations. Hence, in order to find the best positions, many of these equations need to be solved, and so the minimization process can have a high computational cost.   To accelerate the process of finding the optimal positions, we propose a new reduction method. Our algorithm generates a basis spanning an approximation to the solution space of the Lyapunov equations for all possible positions of the dampers. We derive an adaptive scheme that generates the reduced solution space by adding the subspaces of interest, and then we define the corresponding reduced optimization problem that is solvable in a reasonable amount of time. We decouple the solution spaces of the problem to obtain a space that corresponds to the system without external dampers and serves as a starting point for the reduction of the optimization problem. In addition, we derive spaces corresponding to the different damper positions that are used to expand the reduced basis if needed. To evaluate the quality of the basis, we introduce an error indicator based on the space decomposition. Our new technique produces a reduced optimization problem of significantly smaller dimension that is faster to solve than the original problem, which we illustrate with some numerical examples.</details> |

Jonsson et.al. | [2506.20350](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20350) |  | 11 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Simulating and developing large rectangularly shaped arrays with equidistant interspacing is challenging as the computational complexity grows quickly with array size. However, the geometrical shape of the array, appropriately meshed, leads to a multilevel Toeplitz structure in the RWG-based Method of Moment impedance matrix representation that can be used to mitigate the increased complexity. This paper develops, presents and compares two different accelerated solvers that both utilize the matrix structure to determine antenna properties. Both methods use a novel mesh-partitioning algorithm and its associated data representation, reducing storage and computational costs. The first solver is an iterative method based on multilevel fast Fourier transform to accelerate matrix multiplications. The second solver approach is based on an extension of a fast direct Toeplitz solver, adapted to a block-matrix structure. This fast direct solver is demonstrated to have close to machine epsilon accuracy. Both accelerated methods are evaluated on two different array element types, for arrays with up to 900 elements. The results are compared with conventional direct and iterative matrix solvers. Improvements are seen in both the time and required storage to solve the problem. The choice of the most efficient method depends on the residual thresholds in the iterative method, geometry of the element and frequency. Two different preconditioners for the iterative method are investigated to evaluate their performance. The two accelerated methods vastly outperform regular matrix inversion methods.</details> |
| 2025-06-25 | Deep random difference method for high dimensional quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations | Wei Cai, Shuixin Fang, Tao Zhou et.al. | [2506.20308](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20308) |  | 41 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep learning methods is often computationally and memory intensive, primarily due to the need for automatic differentiation (AD) to compute large Hessian matrices in the PDE. In this work, we propose a deep random difference method (DRDM) that addresses these issues by approximating the convection-diffusion operator using only first-order differences and the solution by deep neural networks, thus, avoiding explicit Hessian computation. When incorporated into a Galerkin framework, the DRDM eliminates the need for pointwise evaluation of expectations, resulting in efficient implementation. We further extend the approach to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Notably, the DRDM recovers existing martingale deep learning methods for PDEs (Cai et al., 2024, arXiv:2405.03169), without using the tools of stochastic calculus. The proposed method offers two main advantages: it removes the dependence on AD for PDE derivatives and enables parallel computation of the loss function in both time and space. We provide rigorous error estimates for the DRDM in the linear case, which shows a first order accuracy in $\Delta t$ used in the sampling of the paths by the Euler-Maruyama scheme. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method can efficiently and accurately solve quasilinear parabolic PDEs and HJB equations in dimensions up to $10^4$ and $10^5$ , respectively.</details> |

The TAE method is suitable for $\gamma\leqslant0.27$, while the FAE method can be applied for $\gamma\leqslant 0.65$ . We demonstrate that higher-order perturbation terms capture the nonadiabatic effect, while the zero-order term represents the adiabatic effect.

Piccolroaz et.al. | [2506.20247](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20247) |  | 23 pages, 9 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A linear elastic circular disc is analyzed under a self-equilibrated system of loads applied along its boundary. A distinctive feature of the investigation, conducted using complex variable analysis, is the assumption that the material is incompressible (in its linearized approximation), rendering the governing equations formally identical to those of Stokes flow in viscous fluids. After deriving a general solution to the problem, an isoperimetric constraint is introduced at the boundary to enforce inextensibility. This effect can be physically realized, for example, by attaching an inextensible elastic rod with negligible bending stiffness to the perimeter. Although the combined imposition of material incompressibility and boundary inextensibility theoretically prevents any deformation of the disc, it is shown that the problem still admits non-trivial solutions. This apparent paradox is resolved by recognizing the approximations inherent in the linearized theory, as confirmed by a geometrically nonlinear numerical analysis. Nonetheless, the linear solution retains significance: it may represent a valid stress distribution within a rigid system and can identify critical conditions of interest for design applications.</details> |

While nonconforming for the smooth complex, the discretization conforms to the classical de Rham complex. It is applied to develop a decoupled mixed finite element method for a fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem, focusing on the discretization of a generalized singularly perturbed Stokes-type equation. In contrast to Nitsche's method, which requires additional stabilization to handle boundary layers, the nodal interpolation operator for the lowest-order N\'{e}d\'{e}lec element of the second kind is introduced into the discrete bilinear forms. This modification yields a decoupled mixed method that achieves optimal convergence rates uniformly with respect to the perturbation parameter, even in the presence of strong boundary layers, without requiring any additional stabilization.</details> |

As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</details> |

Comput. Phys. 527 (2025) 113818]. In this paper, we introduce an active birth-death dynamics of particles to improve the efficiency of SPM. The resulting method, dubbed SPM-birth-death, sample new particles according to the nonlinear term and execute the annihilation strategy when the number of particles exceeds a given threshold. Preliminary numerical experiments on the Allen-Cahn equation demonstrate that SPM-birth-death can achieve smaller errors at the same computational cost compared with the original SPM.</details> |
| 2025-06-26 | A quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model for eigenvalue problems | Shengyue Wang, Aihui Zhou et.al. | [2506.20195](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20195) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model for eigenvalue problems of linear operators, aiming to efficiently address many eigenpairs. Our model inherently ensures asymptotic orthogonality: without the need for initial orthogonality, the solution naturally evolves toward being orthogonal over time. We establish the well-posedness of the model, and provide the analytical representation of solutions. Through asymptotic analysis, we show that the gradient converges exponentially to zero and that the energy decreases exponentially to its minimum. This implies that the solution of the quasi-Grassmannian gradient flow model converges to the solution of the eigenvalue problems as time progresses. These properties not only eliminate the need for explicit orthogonalization in numerical computation but also significantly enhance robustness of the model, rendering it far more resilient to numerical perturbations than conventional methods.</details> |

Our methods build on recent advances in entropy-regularized semidefinite programming and are tailored to the unique structure of PPS, in which the unknowns are partial permutation matrices aligning sparse and noisy pairwise correspondences across images. We prove that entropy regularization resolves optimizer non-uniqueness in standard relaxations, and we develop a randomized solver with nearly optimal scaling in the number of observed correspondences. We also develop several rounding procedures for recovering combinatorial solutions from the implicitly represented primal solution variable, maintaining cycle consistency if desired without harming computational scaling. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of speed and accuracy. Our results highlight PPS as a paradigmatic setting in which entropy-regularized SDP admits both theoretical and practical advantages over traditional low-rank or spectral techniques.</details> |

DefElement aims to make information about elements defined in the literature easily available in a standard format. There are a number of open-source finite element libraries available, and it can be difficult to check that an implementation of an element in a library matches the element's definition in the literature or implementation in another library, especially when many libraries include variants of elements whose basis functions do not match exactly. In this paper, we carefully derive conditions under which elements can be considered equivalent and describe an algorithm that uses these conditions to verify that two implementations of a finite element are indeed variants of the same element. The results of scheduled runs of our implementation of this verification algorithm are included in the information available on DefElement.</details> |

We analyze the time-stepping scheme for a large class of potentials which includes the standard potential as well as two extreme settings: Potentials with quadratic convex part (uniform positive curvature), and potentials which are concave between the potential wells and either linear or infinite outside (highly concentrated curvature). In all three scenarios, the 'effective time step size' of the scheme scales with the square of the small parameter $\varepsilon$ governing the width of transition layers. A weaker 'slow motion' result is proved under much more general assumptions. Thus, stability is achieved by effectively 'freezing' the interfaces in place. The time step limitation is not geometric in origin, but depends on the phase-field parameter $\varepsilon$ . Along the way, we establish a new link between an Allen-Cahn type equation and a thresholding approximation of mean curvature flow.</details> |

We investigate the stability and conservation properties of the method, demonstrating that it preserves both mass and energy at the final time, and it is unconditionally stable. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the convergence behavior of the scheme. Incidentally, our analysis also provides an alternative proof of unconditional stability of the first-order-in-time isogeometric method for the wave equation proposed in (M. Ferrari, S. Fraschini, G. Loli and I. Perugia (2025)), eliminating the need for the numerical verifications required in the previous analysis.</details> |

We investigate linear Bayesian inverse problems, where the unknown consists of two components: one smooth and one piecewise constant. We model the unknown as a sum of two components and assign individual priors on each component to impose the assumed behavior. We propose and compare two prior models: (i) a combination of a Haar wavelet-based Besov prior and a smoothing Besov prior, and (ii) a hierarchical Gaussian prior on the gradient coupled with a smoothing Besov prior. To achieve a balanced reconstruction, we place hyperpriors on the prior parameters and jointly infer both the components and the hyperparameters. We propose Gibbs sampling schemes for posterior inference in both prior models. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on 1D and 2D deconvolution problems, where the unknown consists of smooth parts with jumps. The numerical results indicate that our methods improve the reconstruction quality compared to single-prior approaches and that the prior parameters can be successfully estimated to yield a balanced decomposition.</details> |

While widely used in application and subject of many theoretical works, a complete understanding is still missing. Apart from special cases, there does not exist a complete theory that shows how to choose the time steps such that convergence towards the exact solution is guaranteed with the optimal convergence rate. In this work, we use recent advances in adaptive mesh refinement to propose an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is mathematically guaranteed to be optimal in the sense that it achieves the best possible convergence of the error with respect to the number of time steps, and it can be implemented using a time stepping scheme as a black box.</details> |

Our primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust performance than simpler least-squares losses.</details> |

In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</details> |

The HSS iterations involve solving a shifted operator that is suitable for approximation by multigrid using standard smoothers and transfer operators, leading to a fully scalable algorithm. We argue that the algorithm converges in O(k) wallclock time when within the range of scalability of the multigrid. We provide numerical results verifying our proofs and demonstrating this claim. This establishes a scalable O(k) method using multigrid with entirely standard components.</details> |

While the classical continuous setting benefits from Gaussian estimates of the constant coefficient heat kernel, such estimates are not available in the semi-discrete context. To address this complication, we derive estimates involving products of heavy-tailed Lorentz (also known as Cauchy) probability densities. These Lorentzian estimates provide a sufficient handle on certain iterated convolutions involving Bessel functions, enabling us to achieve convergence of the parametrix approach.</details> |

Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.</details> |

The objective of this study is to develop an efficient mathematical tTIS forward modelling scheme that allows for realistic and adaptable simulation and can be updated accurately when the stimulation frequency is modified in one or more electrodes. Such a model is vital, for example, in optimization processes that seek the best possible stimulation currents to exhibit or inhibit a given brain region. This study aims to establish and evaluate the complete electrode model (CEM), i.e., a set of boundary conditions incorporating electrode impedance and contact patch, as a forward finite-element-method-based simulation technique for tTIS and investigate linearized CEM as a surrogate.   Results: The CEM-based forward simulation successfully reproduced the volumetric stimulating fields induced by tTIS. Sensitivity analysis showed that variations in electrode impedance substantially affect the field distribution, especially in regions where the interfering currents have nearly equal amplitudes. The linearized CEM model closely matched the full nonlinear model within a predefined peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) threshold for relative error. Both models exhibited the highest sensitivity near the focal region.</details> |

Our method leverages the Weiler-Atherton clipping algorithm to compute intersections between curved-edge quadrangles, enabling robust handling of arbitrary order isoparametric curves. By integrating multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction, we achieve high-order accuracy while suppressing numerical oscillations near discontinuities. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to ensure physical quantities such as density remain non-negative without compromising conservation or accuracy. Notably, the computational cost of handling higher-order curved meshes, such as cubic or even higher-degree parametric curves, does not significantly increase compared to secondorder curved meshes. This ensures that our method remains efficient and scalable, making it applicable to arbitrary high-order isoparametric curvilinear cells without compromising performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves highorder accuracy, strict conservation (with errors approaching machine precision), essential non-oscillation and positivity-preserving.</details> |

The PIDE involves a supremum over a set of \(\alpha\)-stable L\'evy measures, potentially with degenerate diffusion and a non-separable uncertainty set, which renders existing numerical results inapplicable. We construct a recursive, piecewise-constant approximation to the viscosity solution and derive explicit error bounds. A key application of our analysis is the quantification of convergence rates for the universal robust limit theorem under sublinear expectations, unifying Peng's robust central limit theorem, laws of large numbers, and the \(\alpha\)-stable limit theorem of Bayraktar and Munk, with explicit Berry--Esseen-type bounds.</details> |

Our results reveal that the solution can be more stable with respect to perturbations and numerical errors with respect to the classical bounds for nonlinear systems of equations (based on the norm of the Jacobian). In detail, one can obtain bounds for the minimal solution which ignore the singularity of the problem for $\alpha=1/2$ , and one can show that the limiting accuracy of the Newton method depends not on the norm of the Jacobian but on a quantity that can be much smaller thanks to the nonnegativity structure of the equation. For the minimal solution, we also suggest subtraction-free modifications to the existing algorithms to achieve componentwise stability.   Some of the theoretical results we obtain are interesting even outside the scope of this problem: bounds for more general quadratic vector equations, and a partial inverse for M-matrices which remains bounded when the matrix to invert approaches singularity.</details> |

The interface-attention neural network adopts a network structure similar to the attention mechanism to focus on the interface, with its key extension is to introduce a neural network that transmits interface information.

We characterize the invertibility of the derivative of the skew-restricted exponential, thereby providing a simple expression of the tangent conjugate locus of the orthogonal group. In view of the skew restriction, this characterization differs from the classic result on the invertibility of the derivative of the exponential of real matrices. Based on this characterization, for every skew-symmetric matrix $A$ outside the (zero-measure) tangent conjugate locus, we explicitly construct the domain and image of a smooth inverse -- which we term \emph{nearby logarithm} -- of the skew-restricted exponential around $A$. This nearby logarithm reduces to the classic principal logarithm of special orthogonal matrices when $A=\mathbf{0}$. The symbolic formulae for the differentiation and its inverse are derived and implemented efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed formulae are up to $3.9$-times and $3.6$ -times faster than the current state-of-the-art robust formulae for the differentiation and its inversion, respectively.</details> |

We apply this method to real recordings obtained from a clinical manikin using a digital stethoscope. Results demonstrate distinct latent clusters corresponding to heart and lung sources, as well as accurate reconstructions that preserve key spectral features of the original signals.

Shvarts, Łukasz Kaczmarczyk et.al. | [2506.18206](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18206) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework derived with mixed finite element formulation. The standard approach to diffusion problems requires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the conservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is traditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material models. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material model, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the experimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the need of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation law a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element formulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces while enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner boundaries. This weaker mixed formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for this data-driven approach, enabling adaptive hp-refinement. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how the variation in the datasets results in the non-uniqueness of the solution, which can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated in an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets.</details> |

Filipov et.al. | [2506.18197](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18197) |  | Presented at APS March Meeting 2025 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</details> |

Kühne et.al. | [2506.18190](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190) |  | 6 pages, 5 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</details> |

A range of randomised algorithms, including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore, randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.</details> |

A significant share of particles may collect in strongly overpopulated regions, called clusters. This dynamical clustering, or gas-cluster transition, is caused by a complex interplay and balance between the energy influx and dissipation in particle collisions. Particle number density, container geometry, and excitation strength influence this transition. We perform Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations for ensembles of frictional spheres in a cuboid container and apply the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and a caging criterion to the local packing fraction profiles to detect clusters. Machine learning can be used to study the gas-cluster transition, and can be a promising alternative to identify the state of the system for a given set of system parameters without time-consuming complex DEM simulations. We test various machine learning models and identify the best models to predict dynamical clustering of frictional spheres in a specific experimental geometry.</details> |

Spence et.al. | [2506.15630](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15630) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The $h$-version of the finite-element method ($h$-FEM) applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation has been a classic topic in numerical analysis since the 1990s. It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise polynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions "$(hk)^p \rho$ sufficiently small" and "$(hk)^{2p} \rho$ sufficiently small" guarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative error (BRE), where $\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\rho\sim k$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be optimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates that QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate the conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and in the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the meshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One notable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or nontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e. there is no pollution in the PML.   The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution map behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and data, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays) through these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation requirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the properties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the latest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of $\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true solution on local errors in FEM.</details> |
| 2025-06-18 | Pathwise convergence of a novel numerical scheme based on semi-implicit method for stochastic differential-algebraic equations with non-global Lipschitz coefficients | Guy Tsafack, Antoine Tambue et.al. | [2506.15627](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15627) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper delves into the well-posedness and the numerical approximation of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear local Lipschitz coefficients that satisfy the more general monotonicity condition called Khasminskii condition. The key challenge is the presence of a singular matrix which makes the numerical integration hard and heavy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on semi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs. More precisely we split the drift term as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term. The linear part is approximated implicitly, while the nonlinear part is approximated explicitly. The linear component's role is to handle the singularity issues during the numerical integration without the resolution of nonlinear algebraic equations in the constraint equations. This novel scheme is therefore very efficient for SDAEs in high dimension that come after the spatial discretisation of stochastic partial differential algebraic equations (SPDAEs). To prove the pathwise convergence of our novel scheme, we first derive a equivalent scheme called dual scheme, suitable for mathematical analysis and linked to the inherent stochastic differential equation resulting from the elimination of constraints in the initial SDAEs. We prove that our novel scheme converges to the exact solution with rate $\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$, for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ in the pathwise sense. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme in high dimension and to show that our theoretical results are in agreement with numerical experiments.</details> |

Pohle, Pei-Chun Su et.al. | [2506.15541](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15541) |  | 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers. Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.</details> |

First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$ . Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</details> |
| 2025-06-18 | A deep shotgun method for solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations | Wenjun Xu, Wenzhong Zhang et.al. | [2506.15481](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15481) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recent advances in deep learning makes solving parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) in high dimensional spaces possible via forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) formulations. The implementation of most existing methods requires simulating multiple trajectories of stochastic processes with a small step size of time discretization to ensure accuracy, hence having limited performance, especially when solving on a large time interval. To address such issue, we propose a deep "shotgun method" that does not exploit full trajectories, but only utilizes the data distribution of them. Numerical results including examples with dimensionality up to 10000 demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed shotgun method in both performance and accuracy.</details> |

By first wrapping the target density into a periodic version through modulo operation and subsequently applying kernel ridge regression in scaled Korobov spaces, we extend the kernel approach proposed by Kazashi and Nobile (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2023) and eliminate its requirement for inherent periodicity of the density function. This key modification enables effective estimation of densities defined on unbounded domains. We establish rigorous mean integrated squared error (MISE) bounds, proving that for densities with smoothness of order $\alpha$ and exponential decay, our method achieves the $\mathcal{O}(M^{-1/(1+1/(2\alpha)+\epsilon)})$ MISE convergence rate with an arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$ . While matching the convergence rate of the previous kernel approach, our approach applies to a broader class of non-periodic distributions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate significant improvement over traditional kernel density estimation in large-sample regimes.</details> |

The same can be said for cardiac electrophysiology, wherein fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) have been employed to predict the evolution of an action potential in a 2D space following the two-parameter phenomenological Aliev-Panfilov (AP) model. In this paper, the training behaviour of PINNs is investigated to determine optimal hyperparameters to predict the electrophysiological activity of the myocardium in 3D according to the AP model, with the inclusion of boundary and material parameters. An FCNN architecture is employed with the governing partial differential equations in their strong form, which are scaled consistently with normalization of network inputs. The finite element (FE) method is used to generate training data for the network. Numerical examples with varying spatial dimensions and parameterizations are generated using the trained models. The network predicted fields for both the action potential and the recovery variable are compared with the respective FE simulations. Network losses are weighed with individual scalar values. Their effect on training and prediction is studied to arrive at a method of controlling losses during training.</details> |
| 2025-06-18 | Learning to Maximize Quantum Neural Network Expressivity via Effective Rank | Juan Yao et.al. | [2506.15375](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15375) |  | 6 pages, 5 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance. Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge, impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture, input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that $\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an $n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights, and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes $\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine learning.</details> |

We provide the element-wise and norm-wise sample complexities of the proposed method. Our numerical experiments on different types and dimensions matrices demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate the tightness of theoretical results.</details> |

Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L $_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ ) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.</details> |

Considering the large-scale semilinear stiff matrix differential equations, we propose a dynamic numerical integrator for obtaining low-rank approximations of solutions. We first decompose the differential equation into a stiff linear component and a nonstiff nonlinear term, then employ an exponential integrator along with a dynamic low-rank approach to resolve these subsystems, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework naturally extends to rank-adaptation scenarios. Through rigorous validation on canonical stiff matrix differential problems, including spatially discretized Allen-Cahn equations and differential Riccati equations, we demonstrate that the method achieves the theoretically predicted convergence orders. Numerical evidence confirms the robustness and accuracy of the proposed methods.</details> |

This challenge becomes even more acute in many-query contexts, where numerous simulations must be conducted across a range of time and parameter values. Consequently, it is essential to construct reduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower computational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and parameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models is also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear, non-intrusive, data-driven model order reduction method for the 1D-1V Vlasov--Poisson system, discretized using a Hamiltonian Particle-In-Cell scheme. Our approach relies on a two-step projection framework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic Decomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder neural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian neural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages: first, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots; second, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to simultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics. We validate the proposed method on several benchmarks, including Landau damping and two-stream instability. The results show that our method has better reduction properties than standard linear Hamiltonian reduction methods.</details> |

For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.</details> |

We formulate the inverse problem as an special energy functional minimization with total variation(TV) regularization. The minimization problem is solved by Adam algorithm, which only requires solving one forward problem and no adjoint problem in each iteration. In order to deal with the irregularity of the elastic regions, the anisotropy and heterogeneity of parameters and potential singularities in forward-modeled issues, a novel semi-analytical forward solver named the direct method of lines is proposed, which discretizes angular variable while preserving analytical solutions along remaining coordinates. To validate the efficacy of our procedure, a series of numerical experiments are implemented subsequently, achieving reliable performance in both forward modeling and the six elastic arguments reconstruction scenarios.</details> |

For folded proteins, these intrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow conformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective ANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation functions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We recently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode analysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of conformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity time correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational challenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we demonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be combined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency vibrations at minimal computational cost.</details> |

Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations, together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

As datasets continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning, or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their full empirical eigenspectra.</details> |

Coifman et.al. | [2506.11990](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11990) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a novel framework for fast integral operations by uncovering hidden geometries in the row and column structures of the underlying operators. This is accomplished through an iterative procedure that constructs adaptive hierarchical partition trees, revealing latent multiscale organization and exposing local low-rank structures within the data. Guided by this geometry, we employ two complementary techniques: (1) the \emph{butterfly algorithm}, which exploits the learned hierarchical low-rank structure; and (2) \emph{adaptive best tilings} in both space and frequency using all levels of the generalized Haar--Walsh wavelet packet tree. These techniques enable efficient matrix factorization and multiplication. Unlike classical approaches that rely on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry, our method is fully data-driven and applicable to matrices arising from irregular or unknown distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on matrices associated with acoustic heterogeneous potential operators and families of orthogonal polynomials. The resulting compressed representations reduce storage complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ , enabling fast computation and scalable implementation.</details> |

The methods used can be broadly categorized into scaling approaches and floating-point arithmetic manipulations. Scaling approaches entail re-scaling values to ensure computations stay within a representable range. Floating-point arithmetic manipulations involve changes to order of operations and alternative summation algorithms to minimize errors in calculations. The Implicit Monte Carlo method has nonlinear dependencies, quantities spanning many orders of magnitude, and a sensitive coupling between radiation and material energy that provide significant difficulties to accurate reduced-precision implementations. Results from reduced and higher-precision implementations of IMC solving the Su & Olson volume source benchmark problem are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of a correctly implemented reduced-precision IMC code. We show that the scaling approaches and floating-point manipulations used in this work can produce solutions with similar accuracy using half-precision data types as compared to a standard double-precision implementation.</details> |

We prove polylogarithmic condition number bounds for the preconditioner that are independent of the mesh parameter and number of subdomains, and hold on polytopal meshes. The analysis hinges on the continuity of a face truncation operator, which we prove in the fully discrete polytopal setting. To validate the theory, we present two numerical experiments: the first verifies the truncation estimate, and the second -- a weak scalability test -- verifies the robustness of the condition number bounds for BDDC when applied to second-order elliptic problems discretised using discontinuous skeletal methods, specifically Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) and Hybrid High-Order (HHO) methods.</details> |

Despite being used frequently to produce small-scale components, the application of PM-HIP to large-scale components is limited due to inadequate understanding of its complex mechanisms that cause unpredictable post-HIP shape distortions. A computational model can provide necessary information about the intermediate and final stages of the HIP process that can help understand it better and make accurate predictions. Generally, two types of computational models are employed for PM-HIP simulations, namely, plastic and visco-plastic models. Between these, the plastic model is preferred due to its cheaper calibration approach requiring less experimental data. However, the plastic model sometimes produces incorrect predictions when slight variations of the HIP conditions are encountered in practical situations. Therefore, this work presents a visco-plastic model that addresses these limitations of the plastic model. A novel modified calibration approach is employed for the visco-plastic model that utilizes less experimental data than existing approaches. With the new approach, the data requirement is same for both plastic and visco-plastic models. This also enables a quantitative comparison of plastic and visco-plastic models, which have been only qualitatively compared in the past. When calibrated with the same experimental data, both the models are found to produce similar results. The calibrated visco-plastic model is applied to several complex geometries, and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental observations.</details> |

This paper presents a rigorous analysis for these trace norms with an explicit characterisation by weighted Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms and scaling estimates, highlighting their dependence on the geometry of the extension set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ and the weight $\sigma$. The analysis identifies conditions under which these trace norms are intrinsic to the isolated boundary component $\Gamma\subset\partial\Omega$ and provides $\sigma$-explicit estimates for trace inequalities in weighted spaces. In these natural wavenumber-weighted norms, the boundary integral operators allow improved continuity estimates that do \emph{not} deterioriate as $\sigma\to 0$ .</details> |

An efficient way of dealing with these constraints algorithmically, when the objective functional is convex, is reformulating the constraint using the difference of suitable $L^1$- and largest-$K$-norms and subsequently solving a sequence of penalized subproblems in the difference-of-convex (DC) class. We extend this DC-reformulation approach to problems with $L^0$ -type cardinality constraints on the support of the gradients, \ie, problems where sparsity of the gradient and thus piecewise constant functions are the target.</details> |

The L1+-CN formula is used to discretize the fractional derivative, and an auxiliary variable is introduced to approximate the nonlinear term by solving an algebraic equation rather than a differential equation as in the invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) and scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches. The proposed semi-discrete scheme is linear, second-order accurate in time, and the inconsistency between the auxiliary and the original variables does not deteriorate over time. Furthermore, we prove that the scheme is unconditionally energy stable. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</details> |

The Random Batch Method (RBM) offers significant relief from these demands by enabling the simulation of large-scale systems with reduced computational cost.   In this paper, we analyze the application of RBM for solving PDEs on one-dimensional graphs, specifically concentrating on the heat equation. Our approach involves a two-step process: initially discretizing the PDE to transform it into a finite-dimensional problem, followed by the application of the RBM. We refer to this integrated approach as discretize+RBM. We establish the convergence of this method in expectation, under the appropriate selection and simultaneous reduction of the switching parameter in RBM and the discretization parameters. Moreover, we extend these findings to include the optimal control of the heat equation on graphs, enhancing the practical utility of our methodology. The efficacy and computational efficiency of our proposed solution are corroborated through numerical experiments that not only demonstrate convergence but also show significant reductions in computational costs.   Our algorithm can be viewed as a randomized variant of domain decomposition, specifically adapted for PDEs defined on graph structures. It is sufficiently versatile to be applied to a wide range of linear PDEs -- not just the heat equation -- while maintaining comparable analytical guarantees and convergence properties.</details> |

Ernst, Hanno Gottschalk, Toni Kowalewitz et.al. | [2506.11801](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11801) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This work deals with uncertainty quantification for a generic input distribution to some resource-intensive simulation, e.g., requiring the solution of a partial differential equation. While efficient numerical methods exist to compute integrals for high-dimensional Gaussian and other separable distributions based on sparse grids (SG), input data arising in practice often does not fall into this class. We therefore employ transport maps to transform complex distributions to multivatiate standard normals. In generative learning, a number of neural network architectures have been introduced that accomplish this task approximately. Examples are affine coupling flows (ACF) and ordinary differential equation-based networks such as conditional flow matching (CFM). To compute the expectation of a quantity of interest, we numerically integrate the composition of the inverse of the learned transport map with the simulation code output. As this map is integrated over a multivariate Gaussian distribution, SG techniques can be applied. Viewing the images of the SG quadrature nodes as learned quadrature nodes for a given complex distribution motivates our title. We demonstrate our method for monomials of total degrees for which the unmapped SG rules are exact. We also apply our approach to the stationary diffusion equation with coefficients modeled by exponentiated L\'evy random fields, using a Karhunen-Lo\`eve-like modal expansions with 9 and 25 modes. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate errors due to learning accuracy, quadrature, statistical estimation, truncation of the modal series of the input random field, and training data size for three normalizing flows (ACF, conditional Flow Matching and Optimal transport Flow Matching) We discuss the mathematical assumptions on which our approach is based and demonstrate its shortcomings when these are violated.</details> |

These problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis, prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed, necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions. While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model solution properties and implement them efficiently.   A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational efficiency that was previously inconceivable.   These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications. The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies, their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems and future perspectives in the field.</details> |

In this work, we introduce automatic differentiation (AD) in the element-local time average flux computation step (the predictor step) of Lax-Wendroff methods. The application of AD is similar for methods of any order and does not need positivity corrections during the predictor step. This contrasts with the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure, which requires different finite difference formulas for different orders of the method and positivity corrections in the predictor step for fluxes that can only be computed on admissible states. The method is Jacobian-free and problem-independent, allowing direct application to any physical flux function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the order and positivity preservation of the method. Additionally, performance comparisons indicate that the wall-clock time of automatic differentiation is always on par with the approximate Lax-Wendroff method.</details> |
| 2025-06-13 | Universal Relation between Spectral and Wavefunction Properties at Criticality | Simon Jiricek, Miroslav Hopjan, Vladimir Kravtsov et.al. | [2506.11675](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11675) |  | 11 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility $\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and non-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\chi + D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function $D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.</details> |

It is based on a family of uniform-in-time rational approximants to the matrix exponential that share a common denominator independent of the evaluation time points. The partial fraction decomposition of this family is exploited to devise a fast solver with high parallel efficiency. The number of shifted linear systems that need to be solved in parallel does not depend on the number of required time channels nor the spatial discretization. We also argue that similar parallel efficiency gains can be expected when solving the inverse TEM problem.</details> |

Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance, we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the importance of model design and initialization.</details> |

Hyperinterpolation of degree \( m \) serves as a discrete approximation of the \( L_2 \)-orthogonal projection of the same degree, using Fourier coefficients evaluated by a positive-weight quadrature rule that exactly integrates all polynomials of degree up to \( 2m \). Traditional hyperinterpolation methods often depend on exact quadrature assumptions, which can be impractical in high-dimensional contexts. We address the challenges and advancements in hyperinterpolation, bypassing the assumption of exactness for quadrature rules by replacing it with quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules and propose a novel approximation scheme with an index set \( I \), which is referred to as QMC hyperinterpolation of range \( I \). In particular, we provide concrete construction algorithms for QMC hyperinterpolation with certain lattice rules. Consequently, we show that QMC hyperinterpolation achieves accuracy comparable to traditional hyperinterpolation while avoiding the curse of dimensionality.   Furthermore, we introduce a Lasso-based approach to improve the robustness of QMC hyperinterpolation against noise from sampling processes. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed methods, showing significant improvements in approximation accuracy.</details> |

While function spaces are typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance, neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g., physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing. Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications. This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the steps to make neural operators work in practice.

Recent atomistic `foundation' models have changed the field yet again: trained on many different chemical elements and domains, these potentials are widely applicable, but comparably slow and resource-intensive to run. Here we show how distillation via synthetic data can be used to cheaply transfer knowledge from atomistic foundation models to a range of different architectures, unlocking much smaller, more efficient potentials. We demonstrate speed-ups of $> 10\times$ by distilling from one graph-network architecture into another, and $> 100\times$ by leveraging the atomic cluster expansion framework. We showcase applicability across chemical and materials domains: from liquid water to hydrogen under extreme conditions; from porous silica and a hybrid halide perovskite solar-cell material to modelling organic reactions. Our work shows how distillation can support the routine and computationally efficient use of current and future atomistic foundation models in real-world scientific research.</details> |

However, challenges persist due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell, {\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li $_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$ , in the SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics, underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.</details> |

Notable applications include the recent Muon optimizer or Riemannian optimization on the Stiefel manifold. Among existing approaches, the Newton-Schulz iteration has emerged as a particularly effective solution, as it relies solely on matrix multiplications and thus achieves high computational efficiency on GPU hardware. Despite its efficiency, the method has inherent limitations - its coefficients are fixed and thus not optimized for a given matrix. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a Chebyshev-optimized version of Newton-Schulz (CANS). Based on the Chebyshev's alternance theorem, we theoretically derive optimal coefficients for the 3-rd order Newton-Schulz iteration and apply a Remez algorithm to compute optimal higher-degree polynomials. We leverage these polynomials to construct controlled approximate orthogonalization schemes, which is of interest in deep learning applications. Practically, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness in two key applications: orthogonalization in the Muon optimizer, and providing an efficient retraction alternative for Riemannian optimization on the Stiefel manifold.</details> |

In the context of the diffusion-reaction problem, such an optimization problem seeks for the continuous primal fields (gradient and flux) that are closest to some predefined discrete fields taken from a material data set. The optimization is performed over primal fields that satisfy the physical conservation law and the geometrical compatibility. We consider a reaction term in the conservation law, which has the effect of coupling all the optimality conditions. We first establish the well-posedness in the continuous setting. Then, we propose stable finite element discretizations that consistently approximate the continuous formulation, preserving its saddle-point structure and allowing for equal-order interpolation of all fields. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through a set of numerical examples.</details> |

The approach is based on an integration of dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input, the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline phases.</details> |

To circumvent this problem and further increase the speedup, we combine the ParaDIn method with the Parareal algorithm to efficiently parallelize the first-order time derivative term in nonlinear partial differential equations discretized by the method of lines. The main idea of the proposed approach is to use a block-Jacobi preconditioner, so that each block is solved by using the ParaDIn method. To accelerate the convergence of Jacobi iterations, we use the Parareal method which can be interpreted as a two-level multigrid method in time. In contrast to the conventional Parareal algorithm whose coarse grid correction step is performed sequentially, both the coarse- and fine-grid propagators in the proposed approach are implemented in parallel by using the ParaDIn method, thus significantly increasing the parallel performance of the combined algorithm. Numerical results show that the new combined ParaDIn-Parareal method provides the speedup of up to 124 on 480 computing cores as compared with the sequential first-order implicit backward difference (BDF1) scheme for the 2-D nonlinear heat and Burgers equations with both smooth and discontinuous solutions.</details> |

In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.   To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.   The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.   We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</details> |

Bobbert et.al. | [2506.10794](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10794) |  | 15 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Improving the efficiency and stability of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) will further expand their present success in display applications. Triplet exciton-polaron quenching (TPQ) is an important cause of limited efficiency and stability in modern phosphorescent OLEDs, where triplet excitons are the emitting species. Lack of understanding of the TPQ mechanism in these OLEDs impedes the development of more efficient and stable OLEDs. We investigate the TPQ mechanism for triplet excitons on a phosphorescent guest interacting with hole polarons on a host. Our quantum-chemical calculations show that at distances relevant for TPQ the F\"orster approximation for the TPQ rate fails and that dipole-quadrupole coupling is dominant. This resolves a discrepancy between estimates of the TPQ rate obtained from an OLED device study and from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and absorption spectrum of the charged host. Equivalently to the F\"orster radius for dipole-dipole TPQ, the dipole-quadrupole TPQ rate can be quantified by a dipole-quadrupole radius obtained from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the emitter and the quadrupolar absorption spectrum of the charged host. The findings of this work are expected to have a broad relevance and to be useful in developing phosphorescent emitter-host combinations with reduced TPQ.</details> |

In this method, we combine three strategies to reduce the computing time to solve NSE: time splitting, reduction of the computational domain through non-standard treatment of open boundary conditions and reduced order modelling. To make the work self-contained, we first present the formulation of the time-splitting scheme applied to the Navier-Stokes equations with open boundary conditions, employing a first-order Euler time discretization and deriving the non-standard boundary condition for pressure. Then, we construct a Galerkin projection-based ROM using POD with two different treatments of the pressure boundary condition on the outlet. We propose a comparative performance analysis between the standard projection-based POD-ROM (fully intrusive) and a hybrid POD-ROM that combines a projection-based approach (intrusive) with a data-driven technique (non-intrusive) using Radial Basis Functions (RBF). We illustrate this comparison through two different numerical tests: the flow in a bifurcated tube and the benchmark numerical test of the flow past cylinder, numerically investigating the efficiency and accuracy of both ROMs.</details> |
| 2025-06-12 | Semi-discrete moduli of smoothness and their applications in one- and two- sided error estimates | Danilo Costarelli, Donato Lavella et.al. | [2506.10723](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10723) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we introduce a new semi-discrete modulus of smoothness, which generalizes the definition given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako (KL) in 2023 (in the paper published in the J. Approx. Theory), and we establish very general one- and two- sided error estimates under non-restrictive assumptions. The proposed results have been proved exploiting the regularization and approximation properties of certain Steklov integrals introduced by Sendov and Popov in 1983, and differ from the ones given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako. In addition, the proof of the original KL approximation theorems were strictly related to the application of certain classical results of the trigonometric best approximation, and thus, they are applicable only for operators of the trigonometric type. By the definition of semi-discrete moduli of smoothness here proposed, we are able to deduce applications also for operators that are not necessarily of the trigonometric type, and can also be used to derive sharper estimates than those that can be achieved by the classical averaged moduli of smoothness ( $\tau$ -moduli). Furthermore, a Rathore-type theorem is established, and a new notion of K-functional is also introduced showing its equivalence with the semi-discrete modulus of smoothness and its realization. One-sided estimates of approximation can be established for classical operators on bounded domains, such as the Bernstein polynomials. In the case of approximation operators on the whole real line, one-sided estimates can be achieved, e.g., for the Shannon sampling (cardinal) series, as well as for the so-called generalized sampling operators. At the end of the paper, the case of algebraic Lagrange approximation has been considered, showing the main open problems in order to derive two-sided error estimates in this noteworthy case.</details> |

Recently, motivated by the importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner utilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the denoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency part. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the amplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process. However, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For example, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could over-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the constraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model with doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion models. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion models, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step. We show that in this case, for different model backbones, such as U-Net and neural operators, the outputs of PDE-SpectralRefiner are more accurate for both one-step MSE loss and rollout loss.</details> |

We apply Rothe's method to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (TDDFT) equations of motion for the orbitals, which reformulates them as an optimization problem. We show that thawed, complex-valued Gaussian basis sets can be propagated efficiently for these orbital-based approaches, removing the need for grids. In particular, we illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using just a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both TDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using $30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the one-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.</details> |

Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\text{OC}}$ , texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</details> |

Both algorithms are rooted in the Alternating Steepest Descent (ASD) method for matrix completion, first proposed in [J. Tanner and K. Wei, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 40 (2016), pp. 417-429]. In deriving the new methods we target the X-ray spectromicroscopy undersampling problem, whereby data are collected by scanning a specimen on a rectangular viewpoint with X-ray beams of different energies. The recorded absorptions coefficients of the mixed specimen materials are naturally stored in a third-order tensor, with spatial horizontal and vertical axes, and an energy axis. To speed the X-ray spectromicroscopy measurement process up, only a fraction of tubes from (a reshaped version of) this tensor are fully scanned, leading to a tensor completion problem. In this framework we can apply any transform (such as the Fourier transform) to the tensor tube by tube, providing a natural way to work with the $\star_{M}$-tensor algebra, and propose: (1) a tensor completion algorithm that is essentially ASD reformulated in the $\star_{M}$ -induced metric space and (2) a tensor completion algorithm that solves a set of (readily parallelizable) independent matrix completion problems for the frontal slices of the transformed tensor. The two new methods are tested on real X-ray spectromicroscopy data, demonstrating that they achieve the same reconstruction error with fewer samples from the tensor compared to the matrix completion algorithms applied to a flattened tensor.</details> |

Traditional Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs). These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.</details> |

Martin et.al. | [2506.10533](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10533) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The flow of incompressible fluid in highly permeable porous media in vorticity - velocity - Bernoulli pressure form leads to a double saddle-point problem in the Navier--Stokes--Brinkman--Forchheimer equations. The paper establishes, for small sources, the existence of solutions on the continuous and discrete level of lowest-order piecewise divergence-free Crouzeix--Raviart finite elements. The vorticity employs a vector version of the pressure space with normal and tangential velocity jump penalisation terms. A simple Raviart--Thomas interpolant leads to pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An explicit residual-based a posteriori error estimate allows for efficient and reliable a posteriori error control. The efficiency for the Forchheimer nonlinearity requires a novel discrete inequality of independent interest. The implementation is based upon a light-weight forest-of-trees data structure handled by a highly parallel set of adaptive {mesh refining} algorithms. Numerical simulations reveal robustness of the a posteriori error estimates and improved convergence rates by adaptive mesh-refining.</details> |

Toward this end, we introduce the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm, a multireference quantum variant of the Lanczos algorithm designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenvalues, including degenerate states. We present three different compact quantum circuits to evaluate the required expectation values, each suited to different problem settings. To investigate the impact of the number and fidelity of the initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. The results demonstrate that using multiple initial reference states improves the convergence of the algorithm, especially in realistic precision-limited simulations and in cases where a single reference fails to simultaneously retrieve all desired eigenvalues. Furthermore, the QBKSP algorithm enables the computation of degenerate eigenstates and respective multiplicity by imposing appropriate convergence criteria.</details> |

Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we develop a smoother analogous to element-wise block Gauss-Seidel, except the diagonal block inverses are replaced with an approximation that balances the smoothing of the velocity and pressure variables, factoring in the unequal scaling of the various Stokes system operators, and optimised via two-grid local Fourier analysis. We evaluate the performance of the multigrid solver across an extensive range of two- and three-dimensional test problems, including steady-state and unsteady, standard-form and stress-form, single-phase and high-contrast multiphase Stokes problems, with multiple kinds of boundary conditions and various choices of polynomial degree. In the lowest-degree case, i.e., that of piecewise constant pressure fields, we observe reliable multigrid convergence rates, though not especially fast. However, in every other case, we see rapid convergence rates matching those of classical Poisson-style geometric multigrid methods; e.g., 5 iterations reduce the Stokes system residual by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude.</details> |
| 2025-06-11 | Choosing a Suitable Acquisition Function for Batch Bayesian Optimization: Comparison of Serial and Monte Carlo Approaches | Imon Mia, Mark Lee, Weijie Xu et.al. | [2506.09894](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09894) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Batch Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive experimental processes when several samples can be tested together to save time or cost. A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to guide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or nothing is known about the landscape of the "black box" function to be optimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial and Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that serve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments. The two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which epitomizes a "needle-in-haystack" search, and the Hartmann function, which exemplifies a "false optimum" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper confidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy against Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement (qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests on Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless conditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise, all Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to initial conditions compared to UCB/LP. We then confirm the findings on an empirical regression model built from experimental data in maximizing power conversion efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells. Our results suggest that when empirically optimizing a "black-box" function in less than or equal to six dimensions with no prior knowledge of the landscape or noise characteristics, qUCB is best suited as the default to maximize confidence in the modeled optimum while minimizing the number of expensive samples needed.</details> |

In particular, we focus on ROMs built using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) in an under-resolved and marginally-resolved regime, i.e. when the number of modes employed is not enough to capture the system dynamics. We propose a method to re-introduce the contribution of neglected modes through a quadratic correction term, given by the action of a quadratic operator on the POD coefficients. Differently from the state-of-the-art methodologies, where the operator is learned via least-squares optimisation, we propose to parametrise the operator by a Multi-Input Operators Network (MIONet). This way, we are able to build models with higher generalisation capabilities, where the operator itself is continuous in space -- thus agnostic of the domain discretisation -- and parameter-dependent. We test our model on two standard benchmarks in fluid dynamics and show that the correction term improves the accuracy of standard POD-based ROMs.</details> |

Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</details> |

One potential solution is to learn a direct mapping from the parameters to the PDE solution. Two prominent methods for this are Data-driven Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models (DROMs) and Parametrised Physics Informed Neural Networks (PPINNs). However, their accuracy tends to degrade as the number of geometric parameters increases. To address this, we propose adopting Generative Models to create new geometries, effectively reducing the number of parameters, and improving the performance of DROMs and PPINNs. The first section briefly reviews the general theory of Generative Models and provides some examples, whereas the second focusses on their application to geometries with fixed or variable points, emphasising their integration with DROMs and PPINNs. DROMs trained on geometries generated by these models demonstrate enhanced accuracy due to reduced parameter dimensionality. For PPINNs, we introduce a methodology that leverages Generative Models to reduce the parameter dimensions and improve convergence. This approach is tested on a Poisson equation defined over deformed Stanford Bunny domains.</details> |

Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</details> |

Using our matrix formulation we describe the relation of the spectral approximation problem to semidefinite programming, and we present a simple MATLAB code to solve the problem numerically. We then obtain geometric characterizations of spectral approximations that are based on the $k$-dimensional field of $k$ matrices, which we illustrate with several numerical examples. The general spectral approximation problem is a min-max problem, whose value is bounded from below by the corresponding max-min problem. Using our geometric characterizations of spectral approximations, we derive several necessary and sufficient as well as sufficient conditions for equality of the max-min and min-max values. Finally, we prove that the max-min and min-max values are always equal when we ``double'' the problem. Several results in this paper generalize results that have been obtained in the convergence analysis of the GMRES method for solving linear algebraic systems.</details> |

We augment latent spaces with geometric flows to control structure. Our techniques rely on adaptations of curvature and Ricci flow. We invent new geometric flows or discover them neurally and non-parametrically. All of our flows are solved using physics-informed learning. Traditional geometric meaning is traded for computing ability, but we maintain key geometric invariants, the primary of which are maintained, intrinsically-low structure, canonicity or a lack of irregularity, nontriviality due to sufficient lower bounds on curvature, and distortion of volume element, that develop quality in the inference stage. Our primary contributions are fourfold. We develop a loss based on Gaussian curvature using closed path circulation integration for surfaces, bypassing automatic differentiation of the Christoffel symbols through use of Stokes' theorem. We invent a new parametric flow derived from a linear version of the Gauss equation and a Riemannian decomposition for a custom tensor defined with a normal Hessian and Weyl tensor proxies. We develop two strategies based on time differentiation of functionals, one with a special case of scalar curvature for conformally-changed metrics, and another with harmonic maps, their energy, and induced metrics. Our methods, while diminished analytically, maintain overall integral latent structure. We showcase that curvature flows and the formulation of geometric structure in intermediary encoded settings enhance learning and overall zero-shot and adversarial fidelity.</details> |

It was observed that the addition of carbon nanotubes to the polycarbonate material at frequencies below 1000 Hz increased the reflection of the acoustic wave from the surface of the polycarbonate plate and also decreased the amplitude of the acoustic wave pressure within the material. Therefore, it can be concluded that the reinforcement of polycarbonate plates by carbon nanotubes can reduce the intensity and help absorption of acoustic energy in the plate, and as a result, reduce the transmitted acoustic energy through the plate at low frequencies. Thereupon, these reinforced polycarbonate plates can be used in situations where a sound-absorbing material is needed next to the reflector material in the sound barriers.</details> |

This approach offers two key advantages. First, it extends the insertion window, allowing multiple maneuver opportunities to mitigate potential failures at the nominal insertion point. Second, it enables the required insertion maneuver to be distributed across multiple revolutions, reducing propulsion system constraints in terms of single-burn thrust. Prior research introduced the concept of Energy Transition Domain to support the creation of a comprehensive database of Ballistic Captures in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, to apply these trajectories to a real mission scenario, a three-dimensional, spatial analysis and transition to an ephemeris model are necessary. This paper first extends the Energy Transition Domain framework to the spatial case, constructing an extensive database of spatial Ballistic Captures. Then, using Lunar Trailblazer as a case study, a subset of the trajectories is filtered using a mission-specific distance metric, and transitioned into an ephemeris model.

However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.</details> |

We introduce four data-driven measures using global attractor properties to evaluate the quality of the reconstruction of a given surrogate time series. The measures are robust against the initial position of the chaotic system as they are based on empirical approximations of the correlation integral and the probability density function, both of which are global properties of the attractor. In contrast to previous methods, we do not need a manual fitting procedure, making the measures straightforward to evaluate. Using a hypothesis testing framework, we can systematically find and reject surrogate models whose reconstructions significantly differ from the true system. Further, we show that the measures can be used as a statistical ranking metric, which in practice allows for hyperparameter optimization. Applying our measures to reservoir computing with a low number of nodes, we demonstrate how the measures can be used to reject poor reconstructions and use them as a tool to find an optimal spectral radius for which considerably fewer solutions are rejected and the overall quality of the solution improves.</details> |

In this approach, convection and diffusion can be independently treated either explicitly or implicitly, which in particular allows to construct implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods. Original SRK schemes (Colomes, Badia, IJNME, 2015) are designed for finite-element methods that satisfy the inf-sup condition. In this paper, the idea of SRK schemes is generalized to spatial discretizations with pressure stabilization. In the numerical experiments, SRK schemes are demonstrated with both finite-difference and finite element spatial discretizations. Numerical results show that one of the SRK schemes outperforms the third-order multistep projection-based method in terms of accuracy while preserving the computational costs.</details> |

However, current volume-averaged CFD-DEM relying on direct grid-based mapping between the fluid and particle phases can exhibit a strong dependence on the fluid grid resolution, becoming unstable as particles move across fluid grids, and can fail to capture pore fluid pressure effects in very dense granular systems. Here we propose a two-step mapping CFD-DEM which uses a point-based coarse graining technique for intermediate smoothing to overcome these limitations. The discrete particles are first converted into smooth, coarse-grained continuum fields via a multi-layer Fibonacci point cloud, independent of the fluid grids. Then, accurate coupling is achieved between the coarse-grained, point cloud fields and the fluid grid-based variables. The algorithm is validated in various configurations, including weight allocation of a static particle on one-dimensional grids and a falling particle on two-dimensional grids, sedimentation of a sphere in a viscous fluid, size-bidisperse fluidized beds, Ergun's pressure drop test, and immersed granular column collapse. The proposed CFD-DEM represents a novel strategy to accurately simulate fluid-particle interactions for a wide range of grid-to-particle size ratios and solid concentrations, which is of potential use in many industrial and geophysical applications.</details> |

The method adapts and reinterprets the integral solution of the BGK equation for time-independent solutions. The distribution function at a given point is determined solely by the surrounding equilibrium states, where the corresponding macroscopic quantities are computed through a weighted sum of equilibrium distribution functions from neighboring spatial positions. From a particle perspective, changes in macroscopic quantities within a cell result from particle transport across cell interfaces. These particles are sampled according to the equilibrium state of their original cells, accounting for their mean free path as the traveling distance. The IUGKP method evolves the solution according to the physical relaxation time scale, achieving high efficiency in large Knudsen number regimes. To accelerate convergence for small Knudsen numbers, an inexact Newton iteration method is implemented, incorporating macroscopic equations for convergence acceleration in the near-diffusive limit. The method also addresses spatial-temporal inconsistency caused by relaxation time variations in physical space through the null-collision concept. Numerical tests demonstrate the method's excellent performance in accelerating multi-scale phonon transport solutions, achieving speedups of one to two orders of magnitude. The IUGKP method proves to be an efficient and accurate computational tool for simulating multiscale non-equilibrium heat transfer, offering significant advantages over traditional methods in both numerical performance and physical applicability.</details> |

Using density functional theory calculations, we propose a series of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors with critical temperature above room temperature, including three ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic semiconductors.Their stability is confirmed through phonon spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and formation energy calculations. In particular, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS), Cr2NiSe4, formed via Ni intercalation into bilayer CrSe2, which exhibits a 0.40 eV band gap and a Curie temperature of 352 K. Nonvolatile carrier spin polarization control in Cr2NiSe4 is achieved by switching the ferroelectric polarization of an Al2Se3 substrate. Switching the ferroelectric state of monolayer Al2Se3 induces a BMS-to-half-metal transition. Reversing the polarization of bilayer Al2Se3 yields a half-metallic Cr2NiSe4 with fully opposite carrier spin polarization. Furthermore, we propose a multiferroic nonvolatile memory design: write operations are controlled by the ferroelectric polarization state of bilayer Al2Se3, while read operations rely on detecting the distinct carrier spin polarizations of Cr2NiSe4. Our work reports a two dimensional BMS with Curie temperature above room temperature and presents a feasible strategy for its nonvolatile electrical control.</details> |

Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</details> |

While nonlinear recurrence has long been viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory. Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity, bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.</details> |

However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$ , a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

They have broad applications in combinatorial optimization, high-capacity memory storage, deep learning transformers, and correlated pattern recognition. Thus far, research on DAMs has been primarily theoretical, with implementations limited to CPUs and GPUs. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear optical Hopfield neural network (NOHNN) system for realizing DAMs using correlated patterns. Our NOHNN incorporates effective 2-body and 4-body interactions in its energy function. The inclusion of 4-body interaction scores a minimum ten-fold improvement in the number of uncorrelated patterns that can be stored and retrieved, significantly surpassing the traditional capacity limit for traditional HNNs. For correlated patterns, depending on their average correlation, up to 50 times more patterns can be stored compared to traditional HNNs. To test the system's robustness, the benchmark testing is performed on MNIST handwritten digit patterns. The results show a 5.5 times improvement in the pattern storage along with the retrieval of cleaner and less noisy patterns. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical DAMs for practical applications in challenging big-data optimization, computer vision and graph network tasks.</details> |

Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative learning.</details> |

Thygesen et.al. | [2506.07839](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07839) |  | 15 pages, 5 figures, 1 table | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A key challenge for computational discovery of electrocatalytic materials is the reliable prediction of thermodynamic stability in aqueous environment and under different electrochemical conditions. In this work, we first evaluate the electrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials using conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of thermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast majority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are known to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the surface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that represent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution reactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS $_2$, phosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable by the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U stability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For phosphorene and Ti2$_C$ , the SPD approach is used to investigate the spontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface termination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The SPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for prediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in electrochemical environments.</details> |

Teckentrup et.al. | [2506.07797](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07797) |  | 43 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Kernel interpolation, especially in the context of Gaussian process emulation, is a widely used technique in surrogate modelling, where the goal is to cheaply approximate an input-output map using a limited number of function evaluations. However, in high-dimensional settings, such methods typically suffer from the curse of dimensionality; the number of required evaluations to achieve a fixed approximation error grows exponentially with the input dimension. To overcome this, a common technique used in high-dimensional approximation methods, such as quasi-Monte Carlo and sparse grids, is to exploit functional anisotropy: the idea that some input dimensions are more 'sensitive' than others. In doing so, such methods can significantly reduce the dimension dependence in the error. In this work, we propose a generalisation of sparse grid methods that incorporates a form of anisotropy encoded by the lengthscale parameter in Mat\'ern kernels. We derive error bounds and perform numerical experiments that show that our approach enables effective emulation over arbitrarily high dimensions for functions exhibiting sufficient anisotropy.</details> |

Im et.al. | [2506.07792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07792) |  | 41 pages, 27 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This work presents a unified fluid modeling framework for reacting flows coupled with nonthermal plasmas (NTPs). Building upon the gas-plasma kinetics solver, ChemPlasKin, and the CFD library, OpenFOAM, the integrated solver, reactPlasFOAM, allows simulation of fully coupled plasma-combustion systems with versatility and high performance. By simplifying the governing equations according to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver seamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting flow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional streamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport properties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or electron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE) on the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the cell level. This enables a high-fidelity representation of evolving plasma chemistry and dynamics by capturing temporal and spatial variations in mixture composition and temperature. To improve computational efficiency for this multiscale, multiphysics system, we employ adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the plasma channel, dynamic load balancing for parallelization, and time-step subcycling for fast and slow transport processes. The solver is first verified against six established plasma codes for positive-streamer simulations and benchmarked against Cantera for a freely propagating hydrogen flame, then applied to three cases: (1) spark discharge in airflow; (2) streamer propagation in a premixed flame; and (3) flame dynamics under non-breakdown electric fields. These applications validate the model's ability to predict NTP properties such as fast heating and radical production and demonstrate its potential to reveal two-way coupling between plasma and combustion.</details> |

The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.</details> |

Frequently, the systems are modelled as a network of connected services. Recently, the study of temporal networks has emerged as a way to describe and analyze evolving networks. Previous research has explored how software metrics such as size, complexity, and quality are related to microservice centrality in the architectural network. This study investigates whether temporal centrality metrics can provide insight into the early detection of architectural degradation by correlating or affecting software metrics. We reconstructed the architecture of 7 releases of an OSS microservice project with 42 services. For every service in every release, we computed the software and centrality metrics. From one of the latter, we derived a new metric, Centrality Change Proneness. We then explored the correlation between the metrics. We identified 7 size and 5 complexity metrics that have a consistent correlation with centrality, while Centrality Change Proneness did not affect the software metrics, thus providing yet another perspective and an early indicator of microservice architectural degradation.</details> |

The goal then reduces to finding the optimal coefficient vector that best represents the time derivative of the given data. We review some recent works on the identification of differential equations. We find some common themes for the improved accuracy: (i) The formulation of linear system with proper denoising is important, (ii) how to utilize sparsity and model selection to find the correct coefficient support needs careful attention, and (iii) there are ways to improve the coefficient recovery.

Dielectric properties of all polymers resulting from atomistic calculation were utilized for FDTD simulation, which helps to correlate the direct relationship between polymer structure and optical properties. Notably, the study reveals significant wavelength tunability of 100nm, 40nm, 70nm, and over 40nm using PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh shells, respectively. Additionally, the potential for RGB color production using a TiN layer on the mirror is explored. For the first time, complex structures such as bow tie and gear were utilized to model the nanopixels studied and a significant absorption peak shift was observed. Chromaticity coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space and CIELAB2000 color difference quantify color change capabilities during the redox cycle, and a comparative analysis of organic and inorganic materials highlights the prospects of the proposed plasmonic nanopixels.</details> |

As observed in previous works, the finite element approximations to the GLE are suffering from a numerical pollution effect, that is, the best-approximation error in the finite element space converges under mild coupling conditions between $h$ and $\kappa$, whereas the actual finite element solutions possess poor accuracy in a large pre-asymptotic regime which depends on $\kappa$. In this paper, we provide a new error analysis that allows us to quantify the pre-asymptotic regime and the corresponding pollution effect in terms of explicit resolution conditions. In particular, we are able to prove that higher polynomial degrees reduce the pollution effect, i.e., the accuracy of the best-approximation is achieved under relaxed conditions for the mesh size. We provide both error estimates in the $H^1$- and the $L^2$ -norm and we illustrate our findings with numerical examples.</details> |

We investigate the fine-tuning of two MACE-based foundation models, MACE-MP-0 and its variant MACE-MP-0b, and identify key insights. Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets enhances accuracy and, in some cases, outperforms models trained from scratch. Additionally, fine-tuned models benefit from faster convergence due to the strong initial predictions provided by the foundation model. The success of fine-tuning also depends on careful dataset selection, which can be optimized through filtering or active learning. We further discuss practical strategies for achieving better fine-tuning foundation models in atomistic simulations and explore future directions for their development and applications.</details> |

We first employ the discrete form of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) for model reduction and prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence with respect to the number of local degrees of freedom. The proposed method and its convergence analysis are applicable in broad settings, including general heterogeneous ($L^{\infty}$) coefficients, domains and subdomains with nontrivial topology, irregular subdomain geometries, and high-order finite element discretizations. Furthermore, we formulate the method as an iterative solver, yielding a two-level restricted additive Schwarz type preconditioner based on the MS-GFEM coarse space. The GMRES algorithm, applied to the preconditioned system, is shown to converge at a rate of at least $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the error bound of the discrete MS-GFEM approximation. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in terms of dimensionality reduction.</details> |

We employ a Kohn-Vogelius type variational functional for the regularized reconstruction, and discretize the resulting optimization problem using the Galerkin finite element method on a graded mesh. We establish rigorous error estimates on the recovered Robin coefficient in terms of the mesh size, temporal step size and noise level. This is achieved by combining the approximation error of the direct problem, a priori estimates on the functional, and suitable conditional stability estimates of the continuous inverse problem. We present several numerical experiments to illustrate the approach and to complement the theoretical findings.</details> |

This is particularly evident when employing the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) as the numerical solution technique, which often suffers from inaccuracies induced by artificial reflections from outflow boundaries. This paper investigates the use of neural networks (NN) to mitigate these adverse boundary effects and enable truncated domain requirements. Two distinct NN-based approaches are proposed: (1) direct reconstruction of unknown particle distribution functions at the outflow boundary; and (2) enhancement of established characteristic boundary conditions (CBC) by dynamically tuning their parameters. The direct reconstruction model was trained on data generated from a 2D flow over a cylindrical obstruction. The drag, lift, and Strouhal number were used to test the new boundary condition. We analyzed results for various Reynolds numbers and restricted domain sizes where it demonstrated significantly improved predictions when compared with the traditional Zou & He boundary condition. To examine the robustness of the NN-based reconstruction, the same condition was applied to the simulation of a NACA0012 airfoil, again providing accurate aerodynamic performance predictions. The neural-enhanced CBC were evaluated on a 2D convected vortex benchmark and showed superior performance in minimizing density errors compared to CBCs with fixed parameters. These findings highlight the potential of NN-integrated boundary conditions to improve accuracy and reduce computational expense of aerodynamic and acoustic emissions simulations with the LBM.</details> |

Norton, Yuanzhao Zhang, Michelle Girvan et.al. | [2506.05292](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292) |  | 15 pages, 9 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</details> |

Through the lens of norming sets, we provide a framework for controlling the sketching dimension for \textit{any} sketch operator used to embed said sets, including sub-Gaussian, fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss, and tensor structured sketch operators. Leveraging norming set theory, we propose a new sketching method called the median sketch. It embeds such a set $V$ using only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\dim V)$ tensor structured or sparse linear measurements.</details> |

Varanasi, Arash Noshadravan et.al. | [2506.05122](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05122) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This study examines the feasibility of carbon dioxide storage in shale rocks and the reliability of reactive transport models in achieving accurate replication of the chemo-mechanical interactions and transport processes transpiring in these rocks when subjected to CO2 saturated brine. Owing to the heterogeneity of rocks, experimental testing for adequate deductions and findings, could be an expensive and time-intensive process. Therefore, this study proposes utilization of reactive transport modeling to replicate the pore-scale chemo-mechanical reactions and transport processes occurring in silicate-rich shale rocks in the presence of CO2 saturated brine under high pressure and high temperature. For this study, Crunch Tope has been adopted to simulate a one-dimensional reactive transport model of a Permian rock specimen exposed to the acidic brine at a temperature of 100 {\deg}C and pressure of 12.40 MPa (1800 psi) for a period of 14 and 28 days. The results demonstrated significant dissolution followed by precipitation of quartz rich phases, precipitation and swelling of clay rich phases, and dissolution of feldspar rich phases closer to the acidic brine-rock interface. Moreover, porosity against reaction depth curve showed nearly 1.00% mineral precipitation occur at 14 and 28 days, which is insufficient to completely fill the pore spaces.</details> |

However, existing computational methods cannot account for all possible CSMs. Here, we propose a formalism to classify all CSMs into a tree structure, which is independent of the choices of unit cell and supercell. We rigorously proved that only a finite number of noncongruent CSMs are of practical interest. By representing CSMs as integer matrices, we introduce the crystmatch method to exhaustively enumerate them, which uncontroversially solves the CSM optimization problem under any geometric criterion. For most SSPTs, crystmatch can reproduce all known deformation mechanisms and CSMs within 10 CPU minutes, while also revealing thousands of new candidates. The resulting database can be further used for comparing experimental phenomena, high-throughput energy barrier calculations, or machine learning.</details> |

In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</details> |

The coupled manipulator and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing the robot and fluid dynamics are derived together from a single Lagrangian using the principal of least action. We then employ discrete variational mechanics to derive a stable, implicit time-integration scheme for jointly simulating both the fluid and robot dynamics, which are tightly coupled by a constraint that enforces the no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-robot interface. Extending the classical immersed boundary method, we derive a new formulation of the no-slip constraint that is numerically well-conditioned and physically accurate for multibody systems commonly found in robotics. We demonstrate our approach's physical accuracy on benchmark computational fluid-dynamics problems, including Poiseuille flow and a disc in free stream. We then design a locomotion policy for a novel swimming robot in simulation and validate results on real-world hardware, showcasing our framework's sim-to-real capability for robotics tasks.</details> |

Standard probability of collision methods, based on spherical hard-body assumptions, tend to be overly conservative when applied to long tether systems. We introduce a method that accounts for the tether's spatial extent and configuration uncertainty by maximizing the probability of collision over all physically admissible tether shapes. Applied to real-world conjunction events involving a kilometer-scale flexible inextensible tether, the method yields more realistic risk estimates. This approach improves the ability to distinguish hazardous from benign encounters, thereby supporting more informed collision avoidance decisions.</details> |

Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</details> |

This potential imposes essential physical constraints on the eigenvalues of the $Q$ -tensor, ensuring realistic modeling. We address the approximation of regular solutions to nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions associated with Landau-de Gennes energies. The well-posedness of the discrete linearized problem is rigorously demonstrated. The existence and local uniqueness of the discrete solution is derived using the Newton-Kantorovich theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate an optimal order convergence rate in the energy norm and discuss the impact of eigenvalue constraints on the a priori error analysis.</details> |

This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in controlling divergence error is also validated.</details> |

The proposed algorithms enhance randomized variants of truncated high-order singular value decomposition (T-HOSVD) and sequentially T-HOSVD (ST-HOSVD) by incorporating dynamic shift strategies, which accelerate convergence by refining the singular value gap and reduce the number of required power iterations while maintaining accuracy. Theoretical analyses provide probabilistic error bounds, demonstrating that the proposed methods achieve comparable or superior accuracy compared to deterministic approaches. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms, showing a significant decline in runtime and approximation error over state-of-the-art techniques.</details> |

In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the thermal dynamics of gold-core silica-shell nanoparticles immersed in water under pulse illumination. The plasmonic response of the core-shell nanoparticle is described by incorporating Mie theory with electronic temperature corrections to the refractive indices of gold, based on a Drude Lorentz formulation. The thermal response of the core-shell nanoparticles is modeled by coupling the two temperature model with molecular dynamics simulations, providing an atomistic description of nanoscale heat transfer. We investigate nanoparticles with both dense and porous silica shells (with 50% porosity) under laser pulse durations of 100 fs, 10 ps, and 1 ns, and over a range of fluences between 0.05 and 5mJ/cm2. We show that nanoparticles with a thin dense silica shell (5 nm) exhibit significantly faster water heating compared to bare gold nanoparticles. This behavior is attributed to enhanced electron-phonon coupling at the gold silica interface and to the relatively high thermal conductance between silica and water. These findings provide new insights into optimizing nanoparticle design for efficient photothermal applications and establish a robust framework for understanding energy transfer mechanisms in heterogeneous metal dielectric nanostructures.</details> |

To this aim, a collection of multivariate functions extracted from contributive works coming from different communities, is suggested. First, these functions with varying complexity (e.g. number and degree of the variables) and nature (e.g. rational, irrational, differentiable or not, symmetric, etc.) are used to construct tensors, each of different dimension and size on the disk. Second, grounded on this tensor, we inspect performances of each considered method (e.g. the accuracy, the computational time, the parameters tuning impact, etc.). Finally, considering the "best" parameter tuning set, we compare each method using multiple evaluation criteria. The purpose of this note is not to rank the methods but rather to evaluate as fairly as possible the different available strategies, with the idea in mind to guide users to understand the process, the possibilities, the advantages and the limits brought by each tools. The contribution claimed is to suggest a complete benchmark collection of some available tools for tensor approximation by surrogate models (e.g. rational functions, networks, etc.).

Current reconstruction methods using short exposure bursts face challenges with strong turbulence and high computational costs. We introduce a deep learning approach that reconstructs 100 short exposure images into one high quality image in real time. Using unpaired image to image translation, our model is trained on degraded bursts with speckle reconstructions as references, improving robustness and generalization. Our method shows an improved robustness in terms of perceptual quality, especially when speckle reconstructions show artifacts. An evaluation with a varying number of images per burst demonstrates that our method makes efficient use of the combined image information and achieves the best reconstructions when provided with the full image burst.</details> |

Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the RWG-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method, applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32 array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays. This approach reduces the memory allocation from $\mathcal{O}(N_x^2 N_y^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N_x N_y)$, for an $N_x \times N_y$ array.</details> |

The proposed method employs monotonicity tests to determine the geometric relationship between any given test domain and the actual scatterer. As a result, the shape and location of rigid elastic obstacles can be uniquely identified without requiring any initial guesses or prior knowledge of the physical parameters of the homogeneous background medium.</details> |

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible.

Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.</details> |
| 2025-06-03 | A structure-preserving and thermodynamically compatible cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme for continuum mechanics | Walter Boscheri, Michael Dumbser, Raphael Loubère et.al. | [2506.03081](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03081) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this work we present a novel structure-preserving scheme for the discretization of the Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics written in Lagrangian form. This model admits an extra conservation law for the total energy (first principle of thermodynamics) and satisfies the entropy inequality (second principle of thermodynamics). Furthermore, in the absence of algebraic source terms, the distortion field of the continuum and the specific thermal impulse satisfy a curl-free condition, provided the initial data are curl-free. Last but not least, the determinant of the distortion field is related to the density of the medium, i.e. the system is also endowed with a nonlinear algebraic constraint.   The objective of this work is to construct and analyze a new semi-discrete thermodynamically compatible cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme on moving unstructured meshes that satisfies the following structural properties of the governing PDE exactly at the discrete level: i) compatibility with the first law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete total energy conservation; ii) compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete entropy inequality; iii) exact discrete compatibility between the density and the determinant of the distortion field; iv) exact preservation of the curl-free property of the distortion field and of the specific thermal impulse in the absence of algebraic source terms. We show that it is possible to achieve all above properties simultaneously. Unlike in existing schemes, we choose to directly discretize the entropy inequality, hence obtaining total energy conservation as a consequence of an appropriate and thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other equations.</details> |

Perhaps surprisingly, much less work has been done on understanding how sketch-and-precondition performs on graphics processing unit (GPU) systems. We address this gap by benchmarking an implementation of sketch-and-precondition based on sparse sign-sketches on single and multi-GPU systems. In doing so, we describe a novel, easily parallelized, rejection-sampling based method for generating sparse sign sketches. Our approach, which is particularly well-suited for GPUs, is easily adapted to a variety of computing environments. Taken as a whole, our numerical experiments indicate that sketch-and-precondition with sparse sign sketches is particularly well-suited for GPUs, and may be suitable for use in black-box least-squares solvers.</details> |

This approach preserves high-order accuracy of computations near processing element boundaries using asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes while significantly improving the scalability. The numerical properties of the AT schemes were studied based on simple linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in previous works. Allowing asynchrony in numerical schemes can minimize communication overheads in a parallel setting in two ways: one that avoids communication over a few predetermined time steps, and the other that initiates communications without enforcing synchronization. In this study, the asynchronous algorithms are incorporated into the high-order compressible flow solver COMP-SQUARE, which solves practically relevant flow problems in complex geometries in a multi-block framework. The numerical efficacy and scalability of the two asynchronous algorithms are demonstrated for three test cases: isentropic advection of a vortex, the Taylor-Green vortex, and a much more sensitive case of the flow transitioning on a NACA0012 airfoil. Speed-ups of up to $4\times$ with respect to the baseline synchronous algorithm are observed in the scaling experiments performed on up to 18,432 cores. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of AT schemes on established CFD solvers to improve scalability at extreme scales as the scientific computing environment moves to the exascale era.</details> |

More precisely, we assume that only the averages of $f$ over a given triangulation $\mathcal{T}_N$ of $\Omega$ are available and seek a bivariate polynomial that approximates $f$ using a histopolation approach, potentially flanked by an additional regression technique. This methodology relies on the selection of a subset of triangles $\mathcal{T}_M \subset \mathcal{T}_N$ for histopolation, ensuring both the solvability and the well-conditioning of the problem. The remaining triangles can potentially be used to enhance the accuracy of the polynomial approximation through a simultaneous regression. We will introduce histopolation and combined histopolation-regression methods using the Padua points, discrete Leja sequences, and approximate Fekete nodes. The proposed algorithms are implemented and evaluated through numerical experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in function approximation.</details> |

Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</details> |

The singularity represents a significant challenge for computing the integrals, which is typically overcome via specially designed quadrature methods involving a large number of evaluations of the function and kernel. We present an attractive alternative: we show that Newtonian potentials (and their gradient) applied to (tensor products of) Legendre polynomials can be expressed in terms of complex integrals which satisfy simple and explicit recurrences that can be utilised to exactly compute singular integrals, i.e., singular integral quadrature is completely avoided. The inhomogeneous part of the recurrence has low rank structure (its rank is at most three for the Newtonian potential) and hence these recurrences have displacement structure. Using the recurrence directly is a fast approach for evaluation on or near the integration domain that remains accurate for low degree polynomial approximations, while high-precision arithmetic allows accurate use of the approach for moderate degree polynomials.</details> |

For the latter, we are able to remove an order condition between the characteristic of the field and the size of the matrix as well as decrease a sufficient lower bound on the characteristic by Zhang considerably. Direct applications include a specific real phase retrieval problem as well as a recent result for Riesz bases of exponentials.</details> |

| 2025-06-03 | The Bayesian Finite Element Method in Inverse Problems: a Critical Comparison between Probabilistic Models for Discretization Error | Anne Poot, Iuri Rocha, Pierre Kerfriden et.al. | [2506.02815](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02815) |  | 20 pages, 9 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>When using the finite element method (FEM) in inverse problems, its discretization error can produce parameter estimates that are inaccurate and overconfident. The Bayesian finite element method (BFEM) provides a probabilistic model for the epistemic uncertainty due to discretization error. In this work, we apply BFEM to various inverse problems, and compare its performance to the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) and the statistical finite element method (statFEM), which serve as a frequentist and inference-based counterpart to BFEM. We find that by propagating this uncertainty to the posterior, BFEM can produce more accurate parameter estimates and prevent overconfidence, compared to FEM. Because the BFEM covariance operator is designed to leave uncertainty only in the appropriate space, orthogonal to the FEM basis, BFEM is able to outperform RM-FEM, which does not have such a structure to its covariance. Although inferring the discretization error via a model misspecification component is possible as well, as is done in statFEM, the feasibility of such an approach is contingent on the availability of sufficient data. We find that the BFEM is the most robust way to consistently propagate uncertainty due to discretization error to the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem.</details> |

Armoa et.al. | [2506.02807](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02807) |  | preprint on review | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This work presents an open-source interface that couples the viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) model capable of simulating anisotropic creep and irradiation growth in polycrystalline materials with the finite element solver Code_Aster. The interface enables the simulation of the micromechanical response of irradiated zirconium alloy components by integrating grain-level constitutive behavior into a structural FEM framework. A key feature is the automated rotation of stress and strain tensors between the global FEM frame and the local crystallographic axes, a transformation not natively supported by Code_Aster. The elastic strain is recovered analytically using the inverse of the self-consistently stiffness tensor provided by VPSC. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to an actual model of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) spacer grid, based on a patented design, capturing nonlinear contact and the anisotropic response of the cladding and grid. Simulations reveal the micromechanisms controlling the evolution of clearance between components and highlight the role of crystallographic texture in mitigating wear. In particular, a texture with a high fraction of prismatic planes oriented in the normal direction of the grid appears to be the most suitable for spacer design, as it minimizes clearance and contributes to wear resistance. The interface offers a flexible, extensible platform for high-fidelity simulations in nuclear fuel performance analysis.</details> |

Inspired by the Kuramoto model, we represent MPI processes as coupled oscillators with topology-aware interactions, custom coupling potentials, and stochastic noise. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations opens a path to modeling key performance phenomena of parallel programs, including synchronization, delay propagation and decay, bottlenecks, and self-desynchronization.   This paper introduces interaction potentials to describe memory- and compute-bound workloads and employs multiple quantitative metrics -- such as an order parameter, synchronization entropy, phase gradients, and phase differences -- to evaluate phase coherence and disruption. We also investigate the role of local noise and show that moderate noise can accelerate resynchronization in scalable applications. Our simulations align qualitatively with MPI trace data, showing the potential of physics-informed abstractions to predict performance patterns, which offers a new perspective for performance modeling and software-hardware co-design in parallel computing.</details> |

In this paper, we establish a priori error estimates showing a logarithmic rate of convergence of numerical solutions, constructed via the $\theta$ -method, towards the exact (analytic) flow for a velocity field with Sobolev regularity. In addition, we derive analogous a priori error estimates for Lagrangian solutions of the associated transport equation, exhibiting the same logarithmic rate of convergence. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which confirm the predicted logarithmic behavior.</details> |

Maiti et.al. | [2506.02716](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02716) |  | 7 pages, 5 figures. Comments are welcome | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</details> |

The gradient descent method used to find the optimal control leverages a parallel multilevel Monte Carlo method as stochastic gradient estimator. As a result, we achieve precise control over the stochastic gradient's bias, introduced by numerical approximation, and its sampling error, arising from the use of incomplete gradients, while optimally managing computational resources. We show that the method exhibits linear convergence in the number of optimization steps while avoiding the cost of computing the full gradient at the highest fidelity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms the standard (mini-) batched stochastic gradient descent method in terms of convergence speed and accuracy. The method is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional control problems, taking advantage of parallel computing resources and a distributed multilevel data structure. Additionally, we evaluate and implement different step size strategies, optimizer schemes, and budgeting techniques. The method's performance is studied using a two-dimensional elliptic subsurface diffusion problem with log-normal coefficients and Mat\'ern covariance.</details> |

The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.</details> |

As a first step, we propose a new way to derive the consensus-based sampling (CBS) algorithm, starting from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin diffusions. We approximate the target potential by its Moreau envelope, such that the gradient in the Langevin equation can be replaced by a proximal operator. We then approximate the proximal operator by a weighted mean, and finally assume that the initial and target distributions are Gaussian, resulting in the CBS dynamics. If we keep only those approximations that can be justified in the non-Gaussian setting, the result is a new interacting-particle method for sampling, which we call localized consensus-based sampling. We prove that our algorithm is affine-invariant and exact for Gaussian distributions in the mean-field setting. Numerical tests illustrate that localized CBS compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of affine-invariance and performance on non-Gaussian distributions.</details> |

A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.</details> |

Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</details> |

Oil transport is established in a two step procedure. First, the circulation and flow characteristics of seawater throughout the coastal ocean are established for various flow conditions, including current and proposed channel depth, seasonality changes, and extreme weather events. Then, spilled oil is modeled as distinct particles released at either the proposed onshore or offshore loading locations. The particle trajectories are tracked and used to assess the spread into diverse coastal ecosystems with extensive plant, sea, and land life. The models indicate that the extent of spread of these simulated oil spills to ecologically significant regions is greater when initiated at the onshore loading site than at the offshore site.</details> |

Nanophotonic structures allow us to control light at the nanoscale and offer powerful tools for chiral sensing, enabling the detection of small analyte volumes and low molecular concentrations by harnessing optical resonances. Most existing strategies rely on intuitive concepts such as strong local field enhancement or large local optical chirality, often achieved by engineering electric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric or plasmonic nanostructures. Recent insights, however, reveal that the chiroptical response of resonant systems is governed not only by local field effects, but also by less obvious mechanisms such as modal crosstalk. In this work, we present a dielectric metasurface engineered to amplify the modal crosstalk by supporting two nearly degenerate, high-quality-factor resonant states known as quasi-bound states in the continuum. Our theoretical and numerical analysis predicts a pronounced differential transmittance that exceeds the detection threshold of standard spectrometers. In particular, the differential transmittance reaches up to $10^{-2}$ for the Pasteur parameter $\kappa = 1\cdot10^{-4}$ . These findings advance the capabilities of nanophotonic sensors for chiral detection, paving the way toward ultrasensitive identification of molecular handedness in increasingly smaller volumes and concentrations at the experimentally visible level.</details> |

Here, we focus on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). These flows are characterized by a fine resolution in $z$ -direction and low Mach numbers, making the system stiff. Thus, implicit time integration is required and for this a fast, highly parallel, low-memory iterative solver for the resulting algebraic systems. As a basic framework, we use inexact Jacobian-Free Newton-GMRES with a preconditioner.   For low order finite volume discretizations, multigrid methods have been successfully applied to steady and unsteady fluid flows. However, for high order DG methods, such solvers are currently lacking. %The lack of efficient solvers suitable for contemporary computer architectures inhibits wider adoption of DG methods. This motivates our research to construct a Jacobian-free precondtioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. We design a computationally efficient and mass conservative mapping between the grids. As smoothers, explicit Runge-Kutta pseudo time iterations are used, which can be implemented in parallel in a Jacobian-free low-memory manner.   We consider DG Methods for the Euler equations and for viscous flow equations in 2D, both with gravity, in a well balanced formulation. Numerical experiments in the software framework DUNE-FEM on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach.</details> |

However, the key atomistic forming mechanisms and the physical processes that govern the behavior of this kind of device remain to be clarified. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying its forming at the atomistic level through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an extended charge equilibration scheme to describe the effects of applied voltage with the charge transfer ionic potential formalism. The displacement of the tantalum ions was found to be the highest, followed by that of the hafnium ions, in response to a sufficiently high applied voltage across the electrodes, whereas the oxygen ions had a relatively minor voltage-driven response. This led to the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode acting as the anode and the clustering of oxygen vacancies that nucleated into the filament near the negative bottom electrode, or the cathode. This process resulted in partial shielding of the bulk dielectric from the applied voltage. We found a minimum threshold voltage was required to initiate vacancy clustering to form the filament. Filament growth during forming is attributed to a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which get stabilized by the local electric fields near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</details> |

We investigate the CPBM in the two-dimensional spin-anisotropic attractive Hubbard model by tuning the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping t', carrier filling n, and spin anisotropy alpha, using large-scale constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A moderate NNN hopping (t'/t = 0.2) substantially enlarges the CPBM region: the phase extends into weaker anisotropy regimes and coexists with a commensurate charge-density wave (CDW) near half-filling (n > 0.95), where CDW order would otherwise dominate at t' = 0. Interestingly, t' suppresses the overall CDW peak amplitude and introduces a geometric correlation between the orientations of the Fermi and Bose surfaces: for weak Fermi-surface rotations, the Bose surface remains aligned with the lattice axes, while larger distortions drive both surfaces to rotate in tandem. Momentum-resolved pairing distributions reveal that the bosonic pairing channels are jointly controlled by t' and carrier filling n. For small t', d_xy-wave correlations dominate across the entire filling range. In contrast, for larger t', the dominant pairing symmetry varies with n, reflecting a nontrivial interplay between frustration and density. These findings establish carrier filling and NNN hopping as complementary levers for manipulating CPBM stability and provide concrete criteria for identifying non-superfluid bosonic matter in cold-atom and correlated-electron systems.</details> |

Our algorithm is inspired by the fixed-point iterative scheme of \'Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016) whose convergence to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter relies on obtaining exact optimal transport (OT) maps. However, typically in practice, OT maps are only approximately computed and exact computation of OT maps between continuous probability measures is only tractable for certain restrictive parametric families. To circumvent the need to compute exact OT maps between general non-parametric measures, we develop a tailored iterative scheme that utilizes consistent estimators of the OT maps instead of the exact OT maps. This gives rise to a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm which is provably convergent to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter. Our algorithm remarkably does not restrict the support of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter to be any fixed finite set and can be implemented in a distributed computing environment, which makes it suitable for large-scale data aggregation problems. In our numerical experiments, we propose a method of generating non-trivial instances of 2-Wasserstein barycenter problems where the ground-truth barycenter measure is known. Our numerical results showcase the capability of our algorithm in developing high-quality approximations of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods based on generative neural networks in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency.</details> |

The incident point sources and the receivers for recording scattered signals are both located on a spherical closed surface, on which an outgoing-to-incoming operator is defined for facilitating the factorization of the near-field operator. Numerical examples in 2D are presented to show the validity and accuracy of the inversion algorithm.</details> |

By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 < H < \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach. We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$ .</details> |

Bertozzi et.al. | [2505.24210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24210) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in high-fidelity image and video generation. Because high-quality generations with DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the NFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However, many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method, based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation. Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA. Code is available at https://github.com/ZT220501/STORK.</details> |

In this study, we propose an energy-embedding-based physics-informed neural network method for solving the one-dimensional time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation to obtain ground- and excited-state wave functions, as well as energy eigenvalues by incorporating an embedding layer to generate process-driven data. The method demonstrates high accuracy for several well-known potentials, such as the infinite potential well, harmonic oscillator potential, Woods-Saxon potential, and double-well potential. Further validation shows that the method also performs well in solving the radial Coulomb potential equation, showcasing its adaptability and extensibility. The proposed approach can be extended to solve other partial differential equations beyond the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and holds promise for applications in high-dimensional quantum systems.</details> |

The amplified quantum state, prepared using a quadratic number of alternating unitaries, achieves a constant average-case measurement probability for globally optimal solutions across these problem sizes. This behaviour contrasts with that of classical heuristics, which, for NP-hard optimisation problems, typically exhibit solve probabilities that decay as problem size increases. Performance comparisons with two local-search heuristics on the same benchmark instances suggest that the non-variational QWOA may offer a meaningful advantage by scaling more favourably with problem size. These results provide supporting evidence for the potential of this quantum heuristic to achieve quantum advantage, though further work is needed to assess whether the observed performance scaling persists at larger problem sizes, and to confirm whether similar performance trends are observed for the other problem classes to which the non-variational QWOA is designed to generalise.</details> |

However, the impact of lattice deformation on polarization and photoinduced structural response remains poorly understood. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to demonstrate photodoping-induced lattice expansion in rhombohedrally stacked bilayer MoS2, revealing a strong coupling between photodoping carrier and lattice structure. We identify a pronounced photostrictive response in sliding ferroelectrics, wherein electron-hole excitation leads to substantial in-plane expansion, increased interlayer spacing, and enhanced ferroelectric polarization. This strain-induced modulation drives significant bandgap renormalization. The photostriction-tunable polarization and structural dynamics arise from the strong electromechanical coupling inherent to the non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral stacking. The findings provide critical insights into the nonthermal lattice expansion governing sliding ferroelectrics at atomic-scale timescales, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for next-generation electronic and memory technologies by leveraging lattice-tunable polarization switching.</details> |

In this paper, we propose a method to find analytical solutions where the macroscopic flow profile is known. We test this method on bulk Couette flow aligned and inclined to the simulation lattice with the quadratic and entropic equilibrium distributions. Our method indeed provides an analytical solution to these flows when using the quadratic distribution. When the flow is aligned to the lattice, our method provides an analytical solution using the entropic distribution for practical relaxation times and shear rates. We show that a small even order truncation of the formal solution is optimal for accuracy-compute-time trade-off. In the inclined case, our method does not conserve momentum, by a small relative error, when using the entropic distribution. We also discover that entropic lattice Boltzmann method is not compatible with the angled Couette flow. We discuss the application of our method to more complicated flows.</details> |

The current data-driven approach based on a neural network referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012 airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2. strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of unsteady aerodynamic problems.</details> |

Liu and Z. Wang, J. Comput. Phys., 328(2017)], an arbitrary high-order conservative and energy-dissipative direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) scheme was developed. Although this scheme enforced solution positivity using cell averages as reference values, it lacked a theoretical guarantee for the positivity of those cell averages. In this study, we develop a novel arbitrary high-order DDG method with rigorously proven positivity-preserving properties. Specifically, the positivity of the cell averages is ensured through a modified numerical flux in combination with forward Euler time discretization. To achieve point-wise positivity of ion concentrations, we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates a positivity-preserving limiter. The proposed method is further extended to higher-dimensional problems with rectangular meshes. Numerical results confirm the scheme's high-order accuracy, guaranteed positivity preservation, and consistent discrete energy dissipation.</details> |

The core innovation involves using hierarchical prior-normalizing transport maps (TMs), which are deterministic couplings that transform the sparsity-promoting SBL prior into a standard normal one. We analytically derive these prior-normalizing TMs by leveraging the product-like form of SBL priors and Knothe--Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangements. These transform the complex target posterior into a simpler reference distribution equipped with a standard normal prior that can be sampled more efficiently. Specifically, one can leverage the standard normal prior by using more efficient, structure-exploiting samplers. Our numerical experiments on various inverse problems -- including signal deblurring, inverting the non-linear inviscid Burgers equation, and recovering an impulse image -- demonstrate significant performance improvements for standard MCMC techniques.</details> |

Which components of the model are necessary to accurately model arrhythmogenic tissue modifications, including remodeling, cardiomyopathy, and fibrosis, to ensure reliable simulations? The central question explored is the level of detail required for trustworthy simulations for a specific context of use. The review discusses the balance between model complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting the risks of oversimplification and excessive detail. It covers various aspects of atrial modeling, from cellular to whole atria levels, including the influence of atrial geometry, fiber direction, anisotropy, and wall thickness on simulation outcomes. The article also examines the impact of different modeling approaches, such as volumetric 3D models, bilayer models, and single surface models, on the realism of simulations. In addition, it reviews the latest advances in the modeling of fibrotic tissue and the verification and validation of atrial models. The intended use of these models in planning and optimization of atrial ablation strategies is discussed, with a focus on personalized modeling for individual patients and cohort-based approaches for broader applications. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating experimental data and clinical validation to enhance the utility of computerized atrial models to improve patient outcomes.</details> |

Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve, particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV approaches.</details> |

We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. Moreover, the analytic frequency dependence in the expansion allows for stable analytic continuation to the real-frequency dynamic structure factor. This important application is discussed in a companion letter.</details> |

The so-called $\varepsilon$-subspace embedding property of a sketching matrix $S$ has been largely used to characterize the problem residual norm, since the procedure is no longer optimal in terms of the (classical) Frobenius or Euclidean norm. By building on available results on the SVD of the sketched matrix $SA$ derived by Gilbert, Park, and Wakin (Proc. of SPARS-2013), a novel decomposition of $A$, the $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD, is proposed, which is exact with high probability, and in which the left singular vectors are orthonormal with respect to a (semi-)norm defined by the sketching matrix $S$. The new decomposition is less expensive to compute, while preserving the singular values with probabilistic confidence. The $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD appears to be the right tool to analyze the quality of several sketching techniques in the literature, for which examples are reported. For instance, it is possible to simply bound the distance from (standard) orthogonality of sketched orthogonal matrices in state-of-the-art randomized QR algorithms. As an application, the classical problem of the nearest orthogonal matrix is generalized to the new $S^{\top\!} S$-orthogonality, and the $S^{\top\!} S$ -SVD is used to solve it. Probabilistic bounds on the quality of the solution are also derived.</details> |

Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups.</details> |

Despite the availability of numerous antibacterial drugs today, bacterial diseases continue to pose life-threatening challenges. The credit for this goes to Gram-Negative bacteria, which have developed multi-drug resistant properties towards \b{eta}-lactams, chloramphenicols, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, carbapenems, and macrolide antibiotics. V arious mechanisms of bacterial defence contribute to drug resistance, with Multi-Drug Efflux Pumps and Enzymatic degradation being the major ones. An effective approach to cope with this resistance is to target and inhibit the activity of efflux pumps and esterases. Even though various Efflux Pump Inhibitors and Esterase resistant macrolide drugs have been proposed in the literature, none of them has achieved FDA approval due to several side effects.

There is therefore a strong incentive to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of $S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source MLatom.</details> |

Inexpensive implementation and evaluation, polytopal meshes, iterative linearization and algebraic solvers, and applications to complex porous media flows | Martin Vohralík, Soleiman Yousef et.al. | [2505.23245](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23245) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A posteriori estimates give bounds on the error between the unknown solution of a partial differential equation and its numerical approximation. We present here the methodology based on H1-conforming potential and H(div)-conforming equilibrated flux reconstructions, where the error bounds are guaranteed and fully computable. We consider any lowest-order locally conservative method of the finite volume type and treat general polytopal meshes. We start by a pure diffusion problem and first address the discretization error. We then progressively pass to more complicated model problems, up to complex multiphase multicomponent flow in porous media, and also take into account the errors arising in iterative linearization of nonlinear problems and in algebraic resolution of systems of linear algebraic equations. We focus on the ease of implementation and evaluation of the estimates. In particular, the evaluation of our estimates is explicit and inexpensive, since it merely consists in some local matrix-vector multiplications. Here, on each mesh element, the matrices are either directly inherited from the given numerical method, or easily constructed from the element geometry, while the vectors are the algebraic unknowns of the flux and potential approximations on the given element. Our mtehodology leads to an easy-to-implement and fast-to-run adaptive algorithm with guaranteed overall precision, adaptive stopping criteria for nonlinear and linear solvers, and adaptive space and time mesh refinements and derefinements. Progressively along the theoretical exposition, numerical experiments on academic benchmarks as well as on real-life problems in two and three space dimensions illustrate the performance of the derived methodology. The presentation is largely self-standing, developing all the details and recalling all necessary basic notions.</details> |

The periodic obstacle may include penetrable and impenetrable regions. The TDG method requires the approximation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator on the periodic cell faces, and relies on plane wave discrete spaces. For polygonal meshes, all linear-system entries can be computed analytically. Using a Rellich identity, we prove a new explicit stability estimate for the Helmholtz solution, which is robust in the small material jump limit.</details> |

The proposed PCCU schemes are constructed via flux globalization strategies adapted to the nonconservative form via a path-conservative finite-volume method. The resulting scheme is well-balanced (WB) in the sense that it is capable of exactly preserving physically relevant steady states including moving-water ones. We validate the proposed scheme on several benchmarks, including smooth solutions, small perturbation of steady states, and dam-break scenarios. These results demonstrate that our flux globalization based WB PCCU schemes provide a reliable framework for computing solutions of shallow water moment models with nonlinear and nonconservative features.</details> |

Yet, their largely untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs -- a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO) in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space. As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable, and efficient physics learning.

While the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm is widely used for computing CP decomposition due to its simplicity and empirical success, its theoretical foundation, particularly regarding statistical optimality and convergence behavior, remain underdeveloped, especially in noisy, non-orthogonal, and higher-rank settings.   In this work, we revisit CP tensor decomposition from a statistical perspective and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of ALS under a signal-plus-noise model. We establish non-asymptotic, minimax-optimal error bounds for tensors of general order, dimensions, and rank, assuming suitable initialization. To enable such initialization, we propose Tucker-based Approximation with Simultaneous Diagonalization (TASD), a robust method that improves stability and accuracy in noisy regimes. Combined with ALS, TASD yields a statistically consistent estimator. We further analyze the convergence dynamics of ALS, identifying a two-phase pattern-initial quadratic convergence followed by linear refinement. We further show that in the rank-one setting, ALS with an appropriately chosen initialization attains optimal error within just one or two iterations.</details> |

However, it faces challenges when dealing with problems involving steep gradients. For singularly perturbed time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion equations, which exhibit internal transition layers with sharp gradients, we propose a deep asymptotic expansion (DAE) method that leverages deep learning to obtain explicit smooth approximate solutions. Inspired by asymptotic analysis, we first derive the governing equations for transition layers and then solve them using PINN. Numerical experiments show that DAE outperforms PINN, gPINN and PINN with adaptive sampling. We also show its robustness with respect to training point distributions, network architectures, and random seeds.</details> |

However, this position paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational science.</details> |

We provide families of explicit standing-wave solutions to the hyperbolic system,   which are shown to converge uniformly to ground-state solutions   of NLS in the relaxation limit.   The system is formally equivalent to NLS in the relaxation limit, and we   develop asymptotic preserving discretizations that tend to a consistent discretization   of NLS in that limit, while also conserving mass.   Examples for both the focusing and defocusing regimes demonstrate that the   numerical discretization provides an accurate approximation of the NLS   solution.</details> |

In this work, we demonstrate such a transition in CrSb for a wider array of strains, using a combination of a minimal model and first-principles calculations. Starting from a symmetry perspective, we analyze the spin elastoconductivity tensor, and determine the strain types which allow for a change in the altermagnetic symmetry. We obtain three strain directions, which allow for a $d$ -wave type splitting, and one in which a net magnetic moment emerges. Using first-principles calculations in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we confirm these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, these results do not alter qualitatively in the presence of SOC. Finally, we reveal that the resulting spin currents give rise to a spin-splitter effect of up to 5\% under realistic strains of 1\%, confirming strain as a powerful tool for tuning altermagnetic properties.</details> |

Despite only using computationally cheap forcefield calculations for conformer generation, we observe systematic decrease of machine learning error with increased training set size in all cases, with experimental accuracy reached after training on hundreds of molecules and prediction errors being comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. We also present novel versions of Huber and LogCosh loss functions that made hyperparameter optimization of the new approach more convenient.</details> |

However, most conventional crystal structure prediction methods rely on random structure generation and do not explicitly incorporate polyhedral tiling, limiting their efficiency and interpretability. In this highlight, we introduced a novel crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedral information. The geometry and topology of space-filling polyhedra are encoded as a dual periodic graph, and the corresponding crystal structure is obtained via the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures from their dual periodic graphs. This method offers a new pathway for systematically generating crystal structures based on target polyhedra, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel materials for applications in electronics, energy storage, and beyond.</details> |

In this work, we introduce a scattering transform on an arbitrary finite group (not necessarily abelian) within the context of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). We present wavelets on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural networks.

However, in time-dependent problems, standard training strategies such as teacher forcing introduce a mismatch between training and inference, leading to compounding errors in long-term autoregressive predictions. To address this issue, we propose Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator learning.</details> |

While many mixed-precision algorithms have been developed for iterative sparse linear solvers, effectively leveraging half-precision (fp16) arithmetic remains challenging. This study introduces a novel nested Krylov approach that integrates the flexible GMRES and Richardson methods in a deeply nested structure, progressively reducing precision from double-precision to fp16 toward the innermost solver. To avoid meaningless computations beyond precision limits, the low-precision inner solvers perform only a few iterations per invocation, while the nested structure ensures their frequent execution. Numerical experiments show that using fp16 in the approach directly enhances solver performance without compromising convergence, achieving speedups of up to 1.65x and 2.42x over double-precision and double-single mixed-precision implementations, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms or matches other standard Krylov solvers, including restarted GMRES, CG, and BiCGStab methods.</details> |

In this paper, we present a comparative study of 79 matrices using a broad range of preconditioners. Specifically, we evaluate 10 widely used preconditoners across 108 configurations to assess their relative performance against using no preconditioner. Our focus is on preconditioners that are commonly used in practice, are available in major software packages, and can be utilized as black-box tools without requiring significant \textit{a priori} knowledge. In addition, we compare these against a selection of classical methods. We primarily compare them without regards to effort needed to compute the preconditioner. Our results show that symmetric positive definite systems are mostly likely to benefit from incomplete symmetric factorizations, such as incomplete Cholesky (IC). Multigrid methods occasionally do exceptionally well. Simple classical techniques, symmetric Gauss Seidel and symmetric SOR, are not productive. We find that including preconditioner construction costs significantly diminishes the advantages of iterative methods compared to direct solvers; although, tuned IC methods often still outperform direct methods. Additionally, ordering strategies such as approximate minimum degree significantly enhance IC effectiveness. We plan to expand the benchmark with larger matrices, additional solvers, and detailed metrics to provide actionable information on SPD preconditioning.</details> |

The method supports vector-valued constraints and unstructured meshes, addressing challenges in traditional approaches such as restrictive stability conditions and ill-conditioned systems. Theoretical analysis demonstrates a convergence rate of \( O(h^{1-\epsilon}) \) with a proper chosen time step.

Meanwhile, Krylov subspace methods have emerged as a powerful class of algorithms, known for their robust theoretical foundations and rapid convergence properties. Despite the individual successes of these two paradigms, their underlying connection has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that bridges randomized iterative methods and Krylov subspace techniques, supported by both rigorous theoretical analysis and practical implementation. The core idea is to formulate each iteration as an adaptively weighted linear combination of the sketched normal vector and previous iterates, with the weights optimally determined via a projection-based mechanism. This formulation not only reveals how subspace techniques can enhance the efficiency of randomized iterative methods, but also enables the design of a new class of iterative-sketching-based Krylov subspace algorithms. We prove that our method converges linearly in expectation and validate our findings with numerical experiments.</details> |

However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22\% reduction in mean absolute error over strong baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations.

| 2025-05-26 | A minimax method for the spectral fractional Laplacian and related evolution problems | José A. Carrillo, Stefano Fronzoni, Yuji Nakatsukasa et.al. | [2505.20560](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20560) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a numerical method for the approximation of the inverse of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{s}$, based on its spectral definition, using rational functions to approximate the fractional power $A^{-s}$ of a matrix $A$, for $0<s<1$. The proposed numerical method is fast and accurate, benefiting from the fact that the matrix $A$ arises from a finite element approximation of the Laplacian $-\Delta$, which makes it applicable to a wide range of domains with potentially irregular shapes. We make use of state-of-the-art software to compute the best rational approximation of a fractional power. We analyze the convergence rate of our method and validate our findings through a series of numerical experiments with a range of exponents $s \in (0,1)$ . Additionally, we apply the proposed numerical method to different evolution problems that involve the fractional Laplacian through an interaction potential: the fractional porous medium equation and the fractional Keller-Segel equation. We then investigate the accuracy of the resulting numerical method, focusing in particular on the accurate reproduction of qualitative properties of the associated analytical solutions to these partial differential equations.</details> |

Pan et.al. | [2505.20528](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20528) |  | 21 pages, 9 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A matrix algorithm is said to be superfast (that is, runs at sublinear cost) if it involves much fewer scalars and flops than the input matrix has entries. Such algorithms have been extensively studied and widely applied in modern computations for matrices with low displacement rank and more recently for low-rank approximation of matrices, even though they are known to fail on worst-case inputs in the latter application. We devise novel superfast algorithms that consistently produce accurate 1-norm estimates for real-world matrices and discuss some promising extensions of our surprisingly simple techniques. With further testing and refinement, our algorithms can potentially be adopted in practical computations.</details> |

The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</details> |

Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</details> |

Contact problems are solved using adjoint methods, by switching to the dual system, where the corresponding Lagrange multipliers represent the contact pressure. The Craig-Bampton-like substructuring method is incorporated into the inference process to provide the reduced system matrices and the coupling of the contact and interior nodes. The maximum possible set of contact nodes must be known a priori. Characteristic properties of the inferred matrices, such as symmetry and positive definiteness, are enforced by appending additional constraints to the underlying least-squares problem. The resulting dual system, which forms a linear complementarity problem, is well-defined and can be effectively solved using methods such as Lemke's algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is validated on three-dimensional finite element models.</details> |
| 2025-05-23 | A novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin method for linear elasticity | Shuai Su, Xiurong Yan, Qian Zhang et.al. | [2505.18042](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18042) |  | 20 pages, 11 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose a novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin (EG) method for solving the linear elasticity problem in both two and three dimensions. Unlike existing locking-free EG methods, our method enriches the first-order continuous Galerkin (CG) space with piecewise constants along edges in two dimensions or faces in three dimensions. This enrichment acts as a correction to the normal component of the CG space, ensuring the locking-free property and delivering an oscillation-free stress approximation without requiring post-processing. Our theoretical analysis establishes the well-posedness of the method and derives optimal error estimates. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method.</details> |
| 2025-05-23 | A new class of finite difference methods: The zigzag schemes | Lorenzo Poggioni, Didier Clamond, Yves D'Angelo et.al. | [2505.17969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17969) |  | Main author : Lorenzo Poggioni | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce a novel class of finite difference approximations, termed zigzag schemes, that employ a hybrid stencil that is neither symmetrical, nor fully one-sided. These zigzag schemes often enjoy more permissive stability constraints and see their coefficients vanish as the order tends to infinity. This property permits the formulation of higher order schemes. An explicit formula is given for both collocated and staggered grids for an arbitrary order and a closed-form expression for the infinite-order scheme is also provided. A linear stability analysis indicates that the zigzag scheme offer a broader range of conditional stability compared to the centred and upwind schemes, sometimes being the only stable scheme. Additionally, the asymmetrical structure of the stencil of zigzag schemes prevents some issues such as the formation of ``ghost solutions''. Moreover, implementing zigzag schemes is relatively easy when a code using classical finite differences is available, that is an important feature for well-tested legacy codes. Overall, zigzag schemes provide a compelling alternative for finite differences methods by enabling faster and more stable numerical simulations without sacrificing accuracy or ease of use.</details> |

The operators derived from this basis are banded and achieve optimal complexity regardless of $h$ or $p$ , both for building the discretisation and solving the resulting linear system in the case where the operator is symmetric positive definite. The basis serves as a useful alternative to other bases such as the Fourier or integrated Legendre bases, especially for problems with discontinuities. We relate the convergence properties of these bases to regions of analyticity in the complex plane, and further use several differential equation examples to demonstrate these properties. The basis spans the low order eigenfunctions of constant coefficient differential operators, thereby achieving better smoothness properties for time-evolution partial differential equations.</details> |

Employing two dimensional compressible Euler equations for flows with oblique shocks, this trade-off is studied by varying the number of troubled-cells systematically. An oblique shock is characterized primarily by the upstream Mach number, the shock angle $\beta$, and the deflection angle $\theta$. We study these factors and their combinations and find that the degree of the shock misalignment with the grid determines the optimal number of troubled-cells. On each side of the shock, the optimal set consists of three troubled-cells for aligned shocks, and the troubled-cells identified by tracing the shock and four lines parallel to it, separated by the grid spacing, for nonaligned shocks. We show that the adapted troubled-cell indicator identifies a set of cells that is close to and contains the optimal set of cells for a threshold constant $K = 0.05$ , and consequently, produces a solution close to that obtained by limiting everywhere, but with improved convergence.</details> |

We show that this is already true for very simple feed-forward networks with at least three hidden layers, bounded weights, bounded realization, and sparse connectivity, even if the algorithms are allowed to access the weights of the network. The fundamental idea behind these results is that it is already very hard to check whether a given neural network represents the zero function. The non-locality of the problems above allow us to reduce the approximation setting to deciding whether the input is zero or not. We demonstrate sharpness of our results by providing fast quadrature algorithms for one-layer networks and giving numerical evidence that quasi-Monte Carlo methods achieve the best possible order of convergence for quadrature with neural networks.</details> |

Comments are welcome! | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.</details> |

This study improves IRK efficiency by leveraging parallelism to decouple stage computations and reduce communication overhead, specifically we stably decouple a perturbed version of the stage system of equations and recover the exact solution by solving a Sylvester matrix equation with an explicitly known low-rank right-hand side. Two IRK families -- symmetric methods and collocation methods -- are analyzed, with extensions to nonlinear problems using a simplified Newton method. Implementation details, shared memory parallel code, and numerical examples, particularly for ODEs from spatially discretized PDEs, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IRK technique.</details> |

The construction idea of the preconditioner comes from the thought of Luo et.al [Luo, WH., Gu, XM., Carpentieri, B., BIT 62, 1983-2004(2022)], and the advantage of this is that the preconditioner is closer to the coefficient matrix of the block three-by-three linear systems when the parameter approachs zero. Theoretically, the iteration method under the preconditioner satisfies the conditional convergence, and all eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are real numbers and gathered at point $(1,0)$ as parameter is close to $0$ . In the end, numerical results reflect that the theoretical results is correct and the proposed preconditioner is effective by comparing with serval existing preconditioners.</details> |

Kearney et.al. | [2505.17396](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17396) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Understanding how polymer topology influences melt extrudability is critical for advancing material design in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. In this work, we develop a bottom-up, cross-scale modeling framework that integrates coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and continuum-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to quantitatively assess the effects of polymer architecture on extrudability A range of branched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers are systematically designed by varying backbone length, sidechain length, grafting density, grafted block ratio, and periodicity of grafted-ungrafted segments. CGMD simulations are used to compute zero-shear viscosity and relaxation times, which are then incorporated into the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) model within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict pressure drop of PDMS during extrusion through printer nozzle. Qualitative analysis reveals that polymers with concentrated grafted blocks exhibit significantly higher zero-shear viscosity than stochastically branched analogs, while sidechain inertia drives longer relaxation time. However, for untangled and weakly entangled PDMS, relaxation time remains in the nanosecond range, making shear-thinning and elastic effects negligible. Consequently, zero-shear viscosity emerges as the primary determinant of extrudability. This cross-scale modeling strategy provides a predictive framework for guiding the rational design of extrudable polymer materials with tailored topologies.</details> |

An asymptotic technique is applied to derive equations for the slow evolution of the temporal separation and phase difference of the PQSs interacting through the overlapping of their exponentially decaying oscillating tails. Based on this approach, various stationary states of bound PQS (soliton molecules) with distinct phase differences are predicted. Their stability is addressed via the numerical calculation of the eigenvalue spectrum of small perturbations, showing instability of the bound states. A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that the parameter space of the PQS bound states is organized as a self-similar fractal structure, composed of regions populated by robustly oscillating or splitting two-soliton states. The analytical method and results reported here can be extended for bound states of two or several weakly interacting modes in other conservative and dissipative systems.</details> |

Conventional Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms - fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while disregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that accumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a framework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical time-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical systems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting. Our approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction to the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then integrated using established numerical schemes. This architecture supports continuous-time prediction and enables deployment of higher-precision integrators during inference than those used during training, balancing computational efficiency with predictive accuracy. We further develop TI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate slopes in the integration process, adapting to solution-specific variations and enhancing fidelity. Evaluation across three canonical PDEs shows that TI(L)-DeepONet marginally outperforms TI-DeepONet, with both reducing relative L2 extrapolation errors: approximately 81% over autoregressive and 70% over fixed-horizon methods. Notably, both maintain prediction stability for temporal domains extending to about twice the training interval. This research establishes a physics-aware operator learning paradigm that bridges neural approximation with numerical analysis while preserving the causal structure of dynamical systems.</details> |

These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard reduced-order approaches are not taken into account. In particular, in this work we focus on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based formulation and our goal is to build a closure or correction model, aimed to re-introduce the contribution of the discarded modes. The approach has been investigated in previous works, and the goal of this manuscript is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of machine learning procedures, and, in particular, of deep operator networks. More in detail, we model the closure terms through a deep operator network taking as input the reduced variables and the parameters of the problem. We tested the methods on three test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity, and the geometrically-parametrized backstep flow. The performance of the machine learning-enhanced ROM is deeply studied in different modal regimes, and considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard POD-Galerkin approach.</details> |

This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source: https://github.com/tum-pbs/PICT.</details> |

Mazziotti et.al. | [2505.16989](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16989) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We develop a systematic framework for the spin adaptation of the cumulants of p-particle reduced density matrices (RDMs), with explicit constructions for p = 1 to 3. These spin-adapted cumulants enable rigorous treatment of both S_z and S^2 symmetries in quantum systems, providing a foundation for spin-resolved electronic structure methods. We show that complete spin adaptation -- referred to as complete S-representability -- can be enforced by constraining the variances of S_z and S^2, which require the 2-RDM and 4-RDM, respectively. Importantly, the cumulants of RDMs scale linearly with system size -- size-extensive -- making them a natural object for incorporating spin symmetries in scalable electronic structure theories. The developed formalism is applicable to density-based methods (DFT), one-particle RDM functional theories (RDMFT), and two-particle RDM methods. We further extend the approach to spin-orbit-coupled systems via total angular momentum adaptation. Beyond spin, the framework enables the adaptation of RDM theories to additional symmetries through the construction of suitable irreducible tensor operators.</details> |

However, g-convexity lacks many desirable properties satisfied by Euclidean convexity. For instance, the natural notions of half-spaces and affine functions are themselves not g-convex. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the oracle complexity of geodesically convex optimization necessarily depends on the curvature of the manifold (Criscitiello and Boumal, 2022; Criscitiello and Boumal, 2023; Hamilton and Moitra, 2021), a computational bottleneck for several problems, e.g., tensor scaling. Recently, Lewis et al. (2024) addressed this challenge by proving curvature-independent convergence of subgradient descent, assuming horospherical convexity of the objective's sublevel sets. Using a similar idea, we introduce a generalization of convex functions to Hadamard manifolds, utilizing horoballs and Busemann functions as building blocks (as proxies for half-spaces and affine functions). We refer to this new notion as horospherical convexity (h-convexity). We provide algorithms for both nonsmooth and smooth h-convex optimization, which have curvature-independent guarantees exactly matching those from Euclidean space; this includes generalizations of subgradient descent and Nesterov's accelerated method. Motivated by applications, we extend these algorithms and their convergence rates to minimizing a sum of horospherically convex functions, assuming access to a weighted-Fr\'echet-mean oracle.</details> |
| 2025-05-22 | The Polar Express: Optimal Matrix Sign Methods and Their Application to the Muon Algorithm | Noah Amsel, David Persson, Christopher Musco et.al. | [2505.16932](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16932) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.</details> |

A modification of the classical Jacobi method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher-order Jacobi method, structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that, once the network parameters are determined for a known system, enables efficient resolution of system variations without re-computing the coefficients. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach moves beyond conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis demonstrates improved order of complexity, suggesting a promising direction for algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</details> |

We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</details> |

More specifically, $\tilde X$ is the reversible Markov chain with the closest transition matrix, in the Frobenius norm, to the transition matrix of $X$. To compute the transition matrix of $\tilde X$ , we propose a novel approach based on Riemannian optimization. Our method introduces a modified multinomial manifold endowed with a prescribed stationary vector, while also satisfying the detailed balance conditions, all within the framework of the Fisher metric. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with an existing quadratic programming method and demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of synthetic experiments, as well as in the construction of a reversible Markov chain from transition count data obtained via direct estimation from a stochastic differential equation.</details> |

Our approach synergizes shape optimization with implicit neural representations, introducing key innovations including a shape derivative-based optimization scheme that explicitly incorporates high-contrast interface conditions and an efficient latent space representation that reduces variable dimensionality. Through rigorous theoretical analysis of algorithm convergence and extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements, establishing our framework as promising for practical applications in medical imaging with metallic implants and industrial non-destructive testing.</details> |

The key ingredient is a local inf-sup condition, enabled by enriching the approximation space with appropriate $\boldsymbol{H}$ (d) bubble functions (with d = curl or div). This enrichment allows for the construction of modified interpolation operators, which are crucial for establishing optimal a priori error estimates in the energy norm. Numerical examples are presented to verify both the theoretical results and the stabilization properties of the proposed method.</details> |

The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</details> |

While symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Laser-cooled ions in electromagnetic traps present a pristine and highly controllable, few-body system for examining this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trapping potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a lattice instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. Notably, we observe a triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate tunable Coulomb clusters as a versatile platform to investigate how symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways govern structural transitions in confined few-body systems.</details> |

However, exploring the molecular space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space. Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters. Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.</details> |

Next, we analyze the impact of deflation using carefully selected vectors and combine this with a Complex Shifted Laplacian preconditioner. Finally, we apply these tools to two numerical examples near (quasi-)resonant frequencies, using them to explain how the convergence rate evolves.</details> |

The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences.</details> |

Rossmanith, Christine Vaughan et.al. | [2505.16243](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16243) |  | 9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Vlasov equations model the dynamics of plasma in the collisionless regime. A standard approach for numerically solving the Vlasov equation is to operator split the spatial and velocity derivative terms, allowing simpler time-stepping schemes to be applied to each piece separately (known as the Cheng-Knorr method). One disadvantage of such an operator split method is that the order of accuracy of fluid moments (e.g., mass, momentum, and energy) is restricted by the order of the operator splitting (second-order accuracy in the Cheng-Knorr case). In this work, we develop a novel approach that first represents the particle density function on a velocity mesh with a local fluid approximation in each discrete velocity band and then introduces an operator splitting that splits the inter-velocity band coupling terms from the dynamics within the discrete velocity band. The advantage is that the inter-velocity band coupling terms are only needed to achieve consistency of the full distribution functions, but the local fluid models within each band are sufficient to achieve high-order accuracy on global moments such as mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting scheme is verified on several standard Vlasov-Poisson test cases.</details> |

In this work, we introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically, given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.</details> |

Here, HHO schemes are studied for the space semi-discretization of coupled elasto-acoustic waves in the time domain using a first-order formulation. Explicit and singly diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta (ERK & SDIRK) schemes are used for the time discretization. We show that an efficient implementation of explicit (resp. implicit) time schemes calls for a static condensation of the face (resp. cell) unknowns. Crucially, both static condensation procedures only involve block-diagonal matrices. Then, we provide numerical estimates for the CFL stability limit of ERK schemes and present a comparative study on the efficiency of explicit versus implicit schemes. Our findings indicate that implicit time schemes remain competitive in many situations. Finally, simulations in a 2D realistic geophysical configuration are performed, illustrating the geometrical flexibility of the HHO method: both hybrid (triangular and quadrangular) and nonconforming (with hanging nodes) meshes are easily handled, delivering results of comparable accuracy to a reference spectral element software based on tensorized elements.</details> |

We compare parameters derived from different GLE formulations using molecular dynamics simulations of butane's dihedral angle dynamics. Our analysis reveals non-Gaussian contributions of the orthogonal force in different GLEs, being most enhanced for the Mori-GLE, where all non-linearities are relegated to the orthogonal force. We establish a simulation technique that correctly accounts for non-Gaussian orthogonal forces, which is critical for accurately predicting dihedral-angle mean first-passage times. We find that the accuracy of GLE simulations depends significantly on the chosen GLE formalism; the Mori-GLE offers the most numerically robust framework for capturing the statistical observables of the dihedral angle dynamics, provided the correct non-Gaussian orthogonal force distribution is used.</details> |

Colbrook, Simone Brugiapaglia et.al. | [2505.15661](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15661) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.</details> |

The total average energy over all possible initial data and the total average displacement over all possible initial data. Our first result shows that both criteria are equivalent to the trace minimization of the solution of the Lyapunov equation with different right-hand sides. As the second result, we prove that in the case of damping with one damper, for the discrete system, the minimal trace for each criterion can be expressed as a linear or cubic function of the dimension $n$. Consequently, the optimal damping position is determined solely by the number of dominant eigenfrequencies and the optimal viscosity, independent of the dimension $n$ , offering efficient damping optimization in discrete systems. The paper concludes with numerical examples illustrating the presented theoretical framework and results.</details> |

Recently, power method was proposed by Cui and Qi in Journal of Scientific Computing, 100 (2024) to solve such problem. Recognizing that the convergence rate of power method is slow due to its dependence on the eigenvalue distribution, we propose two improved versions of power method based on dual complex adjoint matrices and Aitken extrapolation, named DCAM-PM and ADCAM-PM. They achieve notable efficiency improvements and demonstrate significantly faster convergence. However, power method may be invalid for dual quaternion Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues having identical standard parts but distinct dual parts. To overcome this disadvantage, utilizing the eigen-decomposition properties of dual complex adjoint matrix, we propose a novel algorithm EDDCAM-EA which surpasses the power method in both accuracy and speed. Application to eigenvalue computations of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in multi-agent formation control and numerical experiments highlight the remarkable accuracy and speed of our proposed algorithms.</details> |

However, due to the absence of theoretical guidance, the key parameters controlling the exponents of M\"untz polynomials are usually determined empirically through extensive numerical experiments, leading to a time-consuming tuning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based optimization framework for the M\"untz spectral method. As an illustrative example, we optimize the parameter selection for solving time-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict optimal parameter values based solely on the time-fractional order as input. The ANN is trained by minimizing solution errors on a one-dimensional time-fractional convection-diffusion equation featuring manufactured exact solutions that manifest singularities of varying intensity, covering a comprehensive range of sampled fractional orders. Numerical results for time-fractional PDEs in both one and two dimensions demonstrate that the ANN-based parameter prediction significantly improves the accuracy of the M\"untz spectral method. Moreover, the trained ANN generalizes effectively from one-dimensional to two-dimensional cases, highlighting its robustness across spatial dimensions. Additionally, we verify that the ANN substantially outperforms traditional function approximators, such as spline interpolation, in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency. The proposed optimization framework can be extended beyond fractional PDEs, offering a versatile and powerful approach for spectral methods applied to various low-regularity problems.</details> |

Directly optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten- $p$ norm, and various nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps. In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks, which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/naiqili/EDLRR.</details> |

Roberts, David Shirokoff, Abhijit Biswas et.al. | [2505.15099](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15099) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Classical convergence theory of Runge-Kutta methods assumes that the time step is small relative to the Lipschitz constant of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). For stiff problems, that assumption is often violated, and a problematic degradation in accuracy, known as order reduction, can arise. High stage order methods can avoid order reduction, but they must be fully implicit. For linear problems, weaker stiff order conditions exist and are compatible with computationally efficient methods, i.e., explicit or diagonally implicit. This work develops a new theory of stiff order conditions and convergence for semilinear ODEs, consisting of a stiff linear term and a non-stiff nonlinear term. New semilinear order conditions are formulated in terms of orthogonality relations enumerated by rooted trees. Novel, optimized diagonally implicit methods are constructed that satisfy these semilinear conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that for a broad class of relevant nonlinear test problems, these new methods successfully mitigate order reduction and yield highly accurate numerical approximations.</details> |

QuPath and PyRadiomics, standardized according to IBSI guidelines, were used to extract 333 imaging features from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, including 240 PF-based-cell detection/intensity, 74 RF-based texture, and 19 RF-based first-order features. Expert-defined ROIs from the public dataset excluded artifact-prone areas, and features were aggregated at the case level. Their relevance to the WHO grading system was assessed using multiple classifiers linked with feature selectors. The resulting dictionary was validated by 8 experts in oncology and pathology. In collaboration with 10 domain experts, we developed a Pathobiological dictionary of imaging features such as PFs and RF. In our study, the Variable Threshold feature selection algorithm combined with the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy (0.80, P-value less than 0.05), selecting 20 key features, primarily clinical and pathomics traits such as Centroid, Cell Nucleus, and Cytoplasmic characteristics. These features, particularly nuclear and cytoplasmic, were strongly associated with tumor grading and prognosis, reflecting atypia indicators like pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, and cellular orientation.The LCP1.0 provides a clinically validated bridge between AI outputs and expert interpretation, enhancing model transparency and usability. Aligning AI-derived features with clinical semantics supports the development of interpretable, trustworthy diagnostic tools for liver cancer pathology.</details> |

However, popular deep learning models often lack auxiliary constraints grounded in physical laws, which could accelerate training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation, making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22 benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from 4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$ -Module achieves best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient and lightweight in training.

Deep learning (DL) models offer efficiency and accuracy but often ignore physical laws, limiting interpretability and generalization. We propose PhyDL-NWP, a physics-guided deep learning framework that integrates physical equations with latent force parameterization into data-driven models. It predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss to align predictions with governing dynamics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both forecasting performance and physical consistency.</details> |

A larger basis of test vectors than that used in conventional multigrid is calculated by the smoother and truncated by singular value decomposition on the chiral components of the test vectors. The truncated basis is used to form the prolongation and restriction matrices of the multigrid hierarchy. This modification of the setup method is demonstrated to increase the convergence of linear solvers on an anisotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 239$ MeV from the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration and an isotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 220$ MeV from the MILC Collaboration. The lattice volume dependence of the method is also examined. Increasing the number of test vectors improves speedup up to a point, but storing these vectors becomes impossible in limited memory resources such as GPUs. To address storage cost, we implement a \emph{streaming} singular value decomposition of the basis of test vectors on the chiral components and demonstrate a decrease in the number of fine level iterations by a factor of 1.7 for $m_q \approx m_{crit}$ .</details> |

While full-scale numerical simulations can capture these effects, they are computationally demanding, especially in time-domain analyses. To overcome this limitation, effective continuum models have been developed to approximate the macroscopic behavior of these materials while retaining key microscale effects. In this work we investigate the time-domain dynamic response of microstructured materials and focus on their effective micromorphic counterparts. We compare direct numerical simulations of discrete microstructures with predictions from micromorphic models to assess their accuracy in capturing transient wave phenomena. Our findings provide new insights into the applicability and limitations of micromorphic models in time-dependent analyses, contributing to the development of improved predictive tools for metamaterial design and engineering applications.</details> |

LeBeau et.al. | [2505.14372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14372) | **[link](https://github.com/hexane360/phaser)** |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Electron ptychography is a groundbreaking technique for the advanced characterization of materials. Successful ptychography relies on robust implementations of reconstruction algorithms with process raw data into phase images. Current software has enabled deep sub-angstrom multislice electron ptychographic reconstructions, but reconstructions remain challenging and computationally expensive. In addition, current software generally lacks the modularity to act as a platform for the development and testing of new solver components and algorithms. For instance, algorithms based on gradient descent and autodifferentiation promise faster reconstructions with higher quality, but it is difficult to implement these algorithms in existing software. Here, we present \texttt{phaser}, an open source Python package which provides a unified interface to both conventional and gradient descent based ptychographic algorithms. Reconstructions are specified in a declarative format, and can be run from a command line, Jupyter notebook, or web interface. Multiple computational backends are supported to provide maximum flexibility. With the JAX computational backend, a 6x improvement in iteration speed is achieved over a state-of-the-art package, \texttt{fold\_slice}. Additionally, \texttt{phaser}'s gradient descent solver achieves improved reconstruction quality.</details> |

Zhang, Daniel Malz, Peter Rabl et.al. | [2505.13401](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13401) |  | 7+3+2 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We study the collective decay of an initially inverted ensemble of two-level emitters into a squeezed photonic reservoir. By using a quantum-state diffusion approach to unravel the emission process, we investigate entanglement and classical correlations along individual quantum trajectories over time. This numerical analysis shows that despite an accelerated initial build-up of entanglement and a significant amount of spin squeezing in the steady state, the essential features of the superradiant burst are well described by averages over fully factorizable states. We explain this observation in terms of an almost complete factorization of all 2-local observables, which we identify as a generic property of superradiant decay. Based on this insight, we provide a purely classical theory for the burst in squeezed superradiance, which is both intuitive and exact for a large number of emitters. Moreover, we show that our numerical approach is also applicable for the investigation of subradiant states, which dominate the slow residual decay of non-uniform ensembles at very long times.</details> |

Gradient descent can be understood as the simplest Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver; namely, the Euler method applied to the gradient flow differential equation. Since Euler, many ODE solvers have been devised that follow the gradient flow equation more precisely and more stably. Runge-Kutta (RK) methods provide a family of very powerful explicit and implicit high-order ODE solvers. However, these higher-order solvers have not found wide application in deep learning so far. In this work, we evaluate the performance of higher-order RK solvers when applied in deep learning, study their limitations, and propose ways to overcome these drawbacks. In particular, we explore how to improve their performance by naturally incorporating key ingredients of modern neural network optimizers such as preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and momentum.</details> |

Explicit flux functions engineered to conserve entropy are introduced within the finite-volume framework. Further, discrete kinetic energy conservation too is introduced. A systematic inquiry is presented, commencing with an overview of numerical entropy conservation and formulation of entropy-conserving and kinetic energy-preserving fluxes, followed by the study of their properties and efficacy. A novelty introduced is to associate numerical entropy conservation to the discretization of the energy conservation equation. Furthermore, an entropy-stable shock-capturing diffusion method and a hybrid approach utilizing the entropy distance to manage smooth regions effectively are also introduced. The addition of artificial viscosity in appropriate regions ensures entropy generation sufficient to prevent numerical instabilities. Various test cases, showcasing the efficacy and stability of the proposed methodology, are presented.</details> |

Power flow (PF) analysis and optimal power flow (OPF) studies are conducted using RTDS coupled with Fujitsu's CMOS Digital Annealer and D-Wave's Advantage quantum processors. The adiabatic quantum power flow (AQPF) and adiabatic quantum optimal power flow (AQOPF) algorithms are used to perform PF and OPF, respectively, on quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are performed on the IEEE 9-bus test system and a modified version that includes solar and wind farms. The findings demonstrate that the AQPF and AQOPF algorithms can accurately perform PF and OPF, yielding results that closely match those of classical Newton-Raphson (NR) solvers while also exhibiting robust convergence. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) within the AQOPF framework proves effective in maintaining system stability and performance, even under variable generation conditions. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to significantly enhance the modeling and control of future power grids, particularly in systems with high renewable energy penetration.</details> |

Karapiperis et.al. | [2505.13305](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13305) |  | 18 pages, 15 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields on cosmological scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the primordial fields without artefacts.</details> |

Bryngelson et.al. | [2505.13283](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13283) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We develop a computational approach that significantly improves the efficiency of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) using local radial basis functions (RBFs). The presented RBF--BOED method uses the intrinsic ability of RBFs to handle scattered parameter points, a property that aligns naturally with the probabilistic sampling inherent in Bayesian methods. By constructing accurate deterministic surrogates from local neighborhood information, the method enables high-order approximations with reduced computational overhead. As a result, computing the expected information gain (EIG) requires evaluating only a small uniformly sampled subset of prior parameter values, greatly reducing the number of expensive forward-model simulations needed. For demonstration, we apply RBF--BOED to optimize a laser-induced cavitation (LIC) experimental setup, where forward simulations follow from inertial microcavitation rheometry (IMR) and characterize the viscoelastic properties of hydrogels. Two experimental design scenarios, single- and multi-constitutive-model problems, are explored. Results show that EIG estimates can be obtained at just 8% of the full computational cost in a five-model problem within a two-dimensional design space. This advance offers a scalable path toward optimal experimental design in soft and biological materials.</details> |

This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</details> |

In this work, we systematically study phonon thermal transport in 16 metals using the efficient homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method and the recently developed unified neuroevolution potential version 1 (UNEP-v1) for 16 metals and their alloys. We compare our results with existing ones based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach and find that our HNEMD results align well with BTE results obtained by considering phonon-phonon scattering only. By contrast, HNEMD results based on the conventional embedded-atom method potential show less satisfactory agreement with BTE ones. Given the high accuracy of the UNEP-v1 model demonstrated in various metal alloys, we anticipate that the HNEMD method combined with the UNEP-v1 model will be a promising tool for exploring phonon thermal transport properties in complex systems such as high-entropy alloys.</details> |

We approximate the weak formulation of this sharp interface model by an unfitted finite element method that uses parametric elements for the representation of the moving interfaces. We establish existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution and prove unconditional stability of the proposed scheme. Moreover, a modification of the original scheme leads to a structure-preserving variant, in that it conserves the discrete analogue of a quantity that is preserved by the classical solution. Some numerical results demonstrate the applicability of our introduced schemes.</details> |

The accelerator section developed at CERN was chosen as a prototype for the structured waveguide under testing. Results of testing the CASCIE-M code confirms that the implementation of matrix open boundary conditions gives possibility to consider the structure in which waves enter and exit without additional reflections from couplers. It was shown that the dependence of the reflection coefficient on frequency differs from the similar dependence for a waveguide with couplers. It does not have a regular sequence of minimum and maximum values associated with reflections from the couplers and the formation of resonance conditions. This indicates that the reflections are of a different nature and are associated with inhomogeneity. The proposed modification of the coupled integral equation method allows us to investigate the accuracy of the field expansion on which coupled mode theory can be constructed that describes structured waveguides.</details> |

The governing equations are approximated using a continuous finite element method, stabilized with a Galerkin least-squares approach.   Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that: $(i)$ the introduction of surface roughness through numerical discretization error, or mesh distortion, makes the potential flow solution unstable; $(ii)$ when numerical surface roughness and mesh distortion are minimized by using high-order isoparametric geometry mappings, a stable potential flow is obtained in both two and three dimensions; $(iii)$ numerical surface roughness, mesh distortion and refinement level can be used as control parameters to manipulate drag and lift forces resulting in numerical values spanning more than an order of magnitude.   Our results cast some doubt on the predictive capability of the slip boundary condition for wall modeling in turbulent simulations of incompressible flow.</details> |

However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This letter presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the constraint equation by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.</details> |

The numerically expensive ACE potential is employed selectively only in regions of the computational cell where large accuracy is required. The comparison with pure EAM and pure ACE simulations shows that for Cu, all potentials yield similar dislocation morphologies under the indenter with only small quantitative differences. In contrast, markedly different plasticity mechanisms are observed for W in simulations performed with the central-force EAM potential compared to results obtained using the ACE potential which is able to describe accurately the angular character of bonding in W due to its half-filled d-band. All ACE-specific mechanisms are reproduced in the AP nanoindentation simulations, however, with a significant speedup of 20-30 times compared to the pure ACE simulations. Hence, the AP potential overcomes the performance gap between the precise ACE and the fast EAM potential by combining the advantages of both potentials.</details> |

However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</details> |

These rely on discretization of input and output functions and are, usually, expensive to train for large-scale problems at high-resolution. Motivated by this, we present a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach to train neural operators by leveraging a hierarchy of resolutions of function dicretization. Our framework relies on using gradient corrections from fewer samples of fine-resolution data to decrease the computational cost of training while maintaining a high level accuracy. The proposed MLMC training procedure can be applied to any architecture accepting multi-resolution data. Our numerical experiments on a range of state-of-the-art models and test-cases demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to traditional single-resolution training approaches, and highlight the existence of a Pareto curve between accuracy and computational time, related to the number of samples per resolution.</details> |
| 2025-05-19 | RGNMR: A Gauss-Newton method for robust matrix completion with theoretical guarantees | Eilon Vaknin Laufer, Boaz Nadler et.al. | [2505.12919](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12919) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.</details> |

In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</details> |

In some cases extensions are possible in order to handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.</details> |

This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$ CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</details> |
| 2025-05-15 | A general regularization strategy for singular Stokes problems and convergence analysis for corresponding discretization and iterative solution | Weizhang Huang, Zhuoran Wang et.al. | [2505.10404](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10404) |  | 26 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A general regularization strategy is considered for the efficient iterative solution of the lowest-order weak Galerkin approximation of singular Stokes problems. The strategy adds a rank-one regularization term to the zero (2,2) block of the underlying singular saddle point system. This strategy includes the existing pressure pinning and mean-zero enforcement regularization as special examples. It is shown that the numerical error maintains the optimal-order convergence provided that the nonzero Dirichlet boundary datum is approximated numerically with sufficient accuracy. Inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners are considered for the regularized system. The convergence analysis for MINRES and GMRES with corresponding block preconditioners is provided for different choices of the regularization term. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to verify the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the preconditioning for solving the regularized system.</details> |

In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</details> |

Various numerical approaches have been proposed to compute geodesics, but so far elude a rigorous convergence theory. By a slick modification of a temporal Galerkin discretization we manage to preserve coercivity and compactness properties of the continuous model and thereby are able to prove convergence for the geodesic boundary value problem. Likewise, for the numerical analysis of the geodesic initial value problem we are able to exploit the geodesic completeness of the underlying continuous model for the error control of a time-stepping approximation. In fact, we develop a convergent discretization of a comprehensive Riemannian calculus that in addition includes parallel transport, covariant differentiation, the Riemann curvature tensor, and sectional curvature, all important tools to explore the geometry of the space of curves. Selected numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings and show the qualitative behaviour. To this end, a low-dimensional submanifold of Sobolev curves with explicit formulas for ground truth covariant derivatives and curvatures are considered.</details> |
| 2025-05-15 | Extension of the consistent $δ^{+}$-SPH model for multiphase flows considering the compressibility of different phases | Xiao-Ting Huang, Peng-Nan Sun, Hong-Guan Lyu et.al. | [2505.10215](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10215) |  | 49 pages, 33 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In hydrodynamic problems involving wave impact on structures, air compressibility is crucial for accurate pressure prediction when an air bubble is entrapped. In this work, the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH model, originally developed for single-phase scenarios, is extended to multiphase contexts. Although the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH model shows good performance for single phase and viscous flow simulations, extending it to multiphase scenarios presents challenges, such as proper implementation of particle shifting for multiphase interfaces. Therefore, within the framework of the consistent $\delta^{+}$-SPH, we introduce the following enhancements: firstly, new strategy for handling $\delta \boldmath{u}$ -terms given by the particle shifting technique at multiphase interfaces are proposed to maintain stability and conservation. Secondly, for modeling of incompressible phases, like water, an acoustic damper term is introduced to alleviate acoustic waves resulting from the weakly-compressible assumption, which is expected to achieve smooth pressure field comparable to truly-incompressible hypothesis, thereby reducing the nonphysical pressure wave during the violent impact state; for modeling compressible phases like air, a physical sound speed is adopted in the equation of state to accurately model real gas phase compressibility. To test and validate the present multiphase SPH model, simulations were conducted for six scenarios. In particular, except for sloshing with two-layer liquids, the other scenarios fully consider air pressure oscillations when air is entrapped, compressed, or expanded by surrounding flows. The results demonstrate significant advantages of the present SPH model in simulating multiphase problems involving strong liquid impact and different phase compressibility.</details> |
| 2025-05-15 | PyLIT: Reformulation and implementation of the analytic continuation problem using kernel representation methods | Alexander Benedix Robles, Phil-Alexander Hofmann, Thomas Chuna et.al. | [2505.10211](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10211) |  | 29 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Computer Physics Communications | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations are a cornerstone for studying quantum many-body systems. The analytic continuation (AC) needed to estimate dynamic quantities from these simulations is an inverse Laplace transform, which is ill-conditioned. If this inversion were surmounted, then dynamical observables (e.g. dynamic structure factor (DSF) $S(q,\omega)$) could be extracted from the imaginary-time correlation functions estimates.   Although of important, the AC problem remains challenging due to its ill-posedness. To address this challenge, we express the DSF as a linear combination of kernel functions with known Laplace transforms that have been tailored to satisfy its physical constraints. We use least-squares optimization regularized with a Bayesian prior to determine the coefficients of this linear combination. We explore various regularization term, such as the commonly used entropic regularizer, as well as the Wasserstein distance and $L^2$ -distance as well as techniques for setting the regularization weight. A key outcome is the open-source package PyLIT (\textbf{Py}thon \textbf{L}aplace \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{T}ransform), which leverages Numba and unifies the presented formulations. PyLIT's core functionality is kernel construction and optimization.   In our applications, we find PyLIT's DSF estimates share qualitative features with other more established methods. We identify three key findings. Firstly, independent of the regularization choice, utilizing non-uniform grid point distributions reduced the number of unknowns and thus reduced our space of possible solutions. Secondly, the Wasserstein distance, a previously unexplored regularizer, performs as good as the entropic regularizer while benefiting from its linear gradient. Thirdly, future work can meaningfully combine regularized and stochastic optimization.   (text cut for char. limit)</details> |

Precisely, we introduce mixed numeric and symbolic computations. A further minor modification of augmenting the input set with additional matrices speeds up the algorithm in certain cases. With this modifications we are able to automatically prove the finiteness conjecture for all pairs of binary $3\times 3$ matrices and sign $2\times 2$ matrices.</details> |

The DHMC was proposed in [Biometrika, 107(2)] for discontinuous potential where the variable has a fixed dimension. When the dimension changes, there is no clear explanation of the volume-preserving property, and the conservation of energy is also not necessary. We use a random sampling for the extra dimensions, which corresponds to a measure transform. We show that when the energy is corrected suitably for the trans-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the detailed balance condition is then satisfied. For the grand canonical ensemble, such a procedure can be explained very naturally to be the extra free energy change brought by the newly added particles, which justifies the rationality of our approach. To sample the grand canonical ensemble for interacting particle systems, the DHMC is then combined with the random batch method to yield an efficient sampling method. In experiments, we show that the proposed DHMC combined with the random batch method generates samples with much less correlation when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings method.</details> |

The intricate interactions arising between the crossflow and the injected jet induce complex flow phenomena, including shock waves and vortical structures, the characteristics of which are significantly contingent upon the thermophysical properties of the injected fuel. While prior investigations have addressed the influence of various fuels, a knowledge gap persists concerning the behaviour of alternative and synthetic multicomponent fuels within this flow regime. The present work employs high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) to examine the impact of ten distinct fuels-hydrogen, methane, ethylene, ammonia, syngas mixture, and a synthetic blend, alongside several NH3/H2/N2 mixtures-on the macroscopic flow structures and mixing attributes within a transverse sonic jet immersed in a Mach 2 crossflow. By maintaining a uniform momentum flux ratio across the investigated cases, the study aims to isolate the influence of the unique thermophysical properties of each fuel on the windward mixing layer, a region critically important for initial entrainment processes. The investigation quantifies the effects of molecular weight, heat capacity ratio, and density on the development and evolution of coherent structures through a detailed examination of instantaneous flow fields, vortex dynamics, scalar distributions, and turbulence statistics. The results are expected to provide pertinent insights into fuel-dependent mixing mechanisms in supersonic flows, thereby contributing to the advancement of more efficient and versatile propulsion systems.</details> |

In non-smooth domains, however, singularities near corners limit the effectiveness of IGA, since standard methods typically fail to achieve optimal convergence rates. These constraints can be addressed through local mesh refinement, but existing approaches require breaking the tensor-product structure of splines, which leads to increased implementation complexity.   This work introduces a novel local refinement strategy based on a polar parameterization, in which one edge of the parametric square is collapsed into the corner. By grading the standard mesh toward the collapsing edge, the desired locality near the singularity is obtained while maintaining the tensor-product structure. A mathematical analysis and numerical tests show that the resulting isogeometric approximation achieves optimal convergence rates with suitable grading parameters.   Polar parameterizations, however, suffer from a lack of regularity at the polar point, making existing standard isogeometric approximation theory inapplicable. To address this, a new framework is developed for deriving error estimates on polar domains with corners. This involves the construction of polar function spaces on the parametric domain and a modified projection operator onto the space of $C^0$ -smooth polar splines. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.</details> |

Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</details> |

Precise and extensive atomic data for low ionisation stages of Sr is required for accurate theoretical modelling and to improve our understanding of evolutionary pathways. We calculated energy levels, Einstein A coefficients and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for Sr I, Sr III, Sr IV and Sr V at the temperature and density ranges of interest in KNe and WD research. We developed new target structures using the GRASP0 and AUTOSTRUCTURE packages. The energies and A-values arising from the new structures were found to be in good agreement with experimental and theoretical equivalents reported in the literature. Maxwellian averaged electron impact collision strengths were calculated using the R-matrix approach, as applied through the DARC and RMBP coding packages. These are presented in adf04 file format. The new data sets allowed us to construct synthetic spectra for the first five ionisation stages of Sr and probe possible density and temperature diagnostic lines. The synthetic spectra within the KNe regime revealed possible Sr IV and Sr V candidate lines at 1027.69nm and 1203.35nm respectively. These may provide useful benchmarks for determining the extent of Sr ionisation that can be reached in an evolving KNe event. Additional diagnostic lines were found to be poor across the Sr ion stages for both KNe and WD regimes due to most levels being in either coronal or Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions.</details> |

Accuracy is validated against high-precision Maple calculations, and benchmarking shows execution time reductions to 54%-80% of Algorithm 644 (in double precision). Quad precision enhances numerical stability and broadens the domain of computations, making the implementation well suited for high-precision applications in physics and engineering.

The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its predictions.</details> |

To formalize this connection, we introduce the notion of dualization, a process that transforms an iterative method for the dual problem into an equivalent method for the primal problem. This concept establishes new connections across these algorithmic classes, encompassing both well-known and new methods. In particular, we show that classical algorithms such as the von Neumann, Dykstra, Peaceman--Rachford, and Douglas--Rachford methods can be interpreted as dualizations of subspace correction methods applied to appropriate dual formulations. Beyond unifying existing methods, our framework enables the systematic development of new algorithms for convex optimization. For instance, we derive parallel variants of alternating projection and operator splitting methods, as dualizations of parallel subspace correction methods, that are well-suited for large-scale problems on modern computing architectures and offer straightforward convergence guarantees. We also propose new alternating direction method of multipliers-type algorithms, derived as dualizations of certain operator splitting methods. These algorithms naturally ensure convergence even in the multi-block setting, where the conventional method does not guarantee convergence when applied to more than two blocks. This unified perspective not only facilitates algorithm design and the transfer of theoretical results but also opens new avenues for research and innovation in convex optimization.</details> |

Leveraging advanced inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and test-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves superhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also present a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing their accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings highlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving, offering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model development.

The method uses a single short trajectory of a dynamical system without any continuation or initial guesses. No preferred coordinate system is required, meaning the method is practical for physical systems where the user does not have much \textit{a priori} knowledge. Three main tools are used to obtain the rotation vector of the invariant torus: the reduced rank extrapolation method, Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation, and a Korkine-Zolatarev lattice basis reduction. The parameterization of the torus is found via a least-squares approach. The robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by accurately computing many two-dimensional invariant tori of a standard map example. Examples of islands and three-dimensional invariant tori are shown as well.</details> |

The proposed methods hinges on a discontinuous Galerkin approximation of the viscous term and a reinforced upwind-type stabilization of the convective term. The derived velocity error estimates account for pre-asymptotic orders of convergence observed in convection-dominated flows through regime-dependent estimates of the error contributions. A complete set of numerical results validate the theoretical findings.</details> |

Moreover, in clinical applications, it is essential to employ computational tools that provide only relevant information, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. In this work, we exploit two recently proposed operator learning approaches, namely Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Kernel Operator Learning (KOL), to learn the operator mapping the applied stimulus in the physical domain into the activation and repolarization time distributions. These data-driven methods are evaluated on synthetic 2D and 3D domains, as well as on a physiologically realistic left ventricle geometry. Notably, while the learned map between the applied current and activation time has its modelling counterpart in the Eikonal model, no equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) model is known for the map between the applied current and repolarization time. Our results demonstrate that both FNO and KOL approaches are robust to hyperparameter choices and computationally efficient compared to traditional PDE-based Monodomain models. These findings highlight the potential use of these surrogate operators to accelerate cardiac simulations and facilitate their clinical integration.</details> |

Barnafi, Massimiliano Lupo Pasini et.al. | [2505.08587](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08587) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a novel two-level sketching extension of the Alternating Anderson-Picard (AAP) method for accelerating fixed-point iterations in challenging single- and multi-physics simulations governed by discretized partial differential equations. Our approach combines a static, physics-based projection that reduces the least-squares problem to the most informative field (e.g., via Schur-complement insight) with a dynamic, algebraic sketching stage driven by a backward stability analysis under Lipschitz continuity. We introduce inexpensive estimators for stability thresholds and cache-aware randomized selection strategies to balance computational cost against memory-access overhead. The resulting algorithm solves reduced least-squares systems in place, minimizes memory footprints, and seamlessly alternates between low-cost Picard updates and Anderson mixing. Implemented in Julia, our two-level sketching AAP achieves up to 50% time-to-solution reductions compared to standard Anderson acceleration-without degrading convergence rates-on benchmark problems including Stokes, p-Laplacian, Bidomain, and Navier-Stokes formulations at varying problem sizes. These results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and potential for integration into high-performance scientific computing frameworks. Our implementation is available open-source in the AAP.jl library.</details> |

First, the correction step employs a novel enhanced stochastic differential editing technique based on an imbalanced perturbation and denoising process, ensuring robust and effective bias correction at the low-resolution level. The robustness and effectiveness of this approach are validated theoretically and experimentally. Next, the super-resolution step leverages cascaded conditional diffusion models to iteratively refine the corrected data to high-resolution. Numerical experiments on three PDE problems and a climate dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances low-fidelity, low-resolution data by correcting numerical errors and noise while simultaneously improving resolution to recover fine-scale structures.</details> |

Building on the finite volume discretization method from [{\sc M. Banda and M. Herty}, Math. Control Relat.

For linear systems, we derive explicit decay rates, which depend on boundary control parameters, grid resolutions, and the statistical properties of the random inputs. Theoretical decay rates are verified through numerical examples, including boundary stabilization of the linear wave equations and linearized shallow-water flows with random perturbations. We also demonstrate the decay rates for a nonlinear example.</details> |

Moreover, the computational workload increases considerably when attempting to accurately capture the behavior of the system under significant variations or uncertainties in the low-dimensional structures such as fractures, fibers, or vascular networks, due to the inevitable necessity of running multiple simulations. In this work, we present a novel preconditioning strategy that leverages neural networks and unsupervised operator learning to design an efficient preconditioner specifically tailored to a class of 3D-1D mixed-dimensional PDEs. The proposed approach is capable of generalizing to varying shapes of the 1D manifold without retraining, making it robust to changes in the 1D graph topology. Moreover, thanks to convolutional neural networks, the neural preconditioner can adapt over a range of increasing mesh resolutions of the discrete problem, enabling us to train it on low resolution problems and deploy it on higher resolutions. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the preconditioner in accelerating convergence in iterative solvers, demonstrating its appeal and limitations over traditional methods. This study lays the groundwork for applying neural network-based preconditioning techniques to a broader range of coupled multi-physics systems.</details> |
| 2025-05-13 | Reconstructing initial pressure and speed of sound distributions simultaneously in photoacoustic tomography | Miika Suhonen, Felix Lucka, Aki Pulkkinen et.al. | [2505.08482](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08482) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Image reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography relies on an accurate knowledge of the speed of sound in the target. However, the speed of sound distribution is not generally known, which may result in artefacts in the reconstructed distribution of initial pressure. Therefore, reconstructing the speed of sound simultaneously with the initial pressure would be valuable for accurate imaging in photoacoustic tomography. Furthermore, the speed of sound distribution could provide additional valuable information about the imaged target. In this work, simultaneous reconstruction of initial pressure and speed of sound in photoacoustic tomography is studied. This inverse problem is known to be highly ill-posed. To overcome this, we study an approach where the ill-posedness is alleviated by utilising multiple photoacoustic data sets that are generated by different initial pressure distributions within the same imaged target. Then, these initial pressure distributions are reconstructed simultaneously with the speed of sound distribution. A methodology for solving this minimisation problem is formulated using a gradient-based iterative approach equipped with bound constraints and a multigrid approach. The methodology was evaluated with numerical simulations. Different approaches for generating multiple initial pressure distributions and their effect on the solution of the image reconstruction problem were studied. The results show that initial pressure and speed of sound can be simultaneously reconstructed from photoacoustic data. Furthermore, utilising multiple initial pressure distributions improves the reconstructions such that the locations of initial pressure and speed of sound inhomogeneities can be better distinguished and image artifacts are reduced.</details> |

While essential in geometric and topological applications, computing the reach explicitly is notoriously difficult. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous and practical method to compute a guaranteed lower bound for the reach of a submanifold described as the common zero-set of finitely many smooth functions, not necessarily polynomials. Our algorithm uses techniques from numerically verified proofs and is particularly suitable for high-performance parallel implementations.   We illustrate the utility of this method through several applications. Of special note is a novel algorithm for computing the homology groups of planar curves, achieved by constructing a cubical complex that deformation retracts onto the curve--an approach potentially extendable to higher-dimensional manifolds. Additional applications include an improved comparison inequality between intrinsic and extrinsic distances for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^N$ , lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on algebraic varieties and explicit bounds on how much smooth varieties can be deformed without changing their diffeomorphism type.</details> |
| 2025-05-13 | A Fourier finite volume approach for the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography | David J. Chappell et.al. | [2505.08400](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08400) |  | 15 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A new approach for solving the optical inverse problem of quantitative photoacoustic tomography is introduced, which interpolates between the well-known diffusion approximation and a radiative transfer equation based model. The proposed formulation combines a spatial finite volume scheme with a truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable for the radiative transfer equation. The finite volume scheme provides a natural and simple approach for representing piecewise constant image data modelled using transport equations. The truncated Fourier expansion in the direction variable facilitates the interpolation between the diffusion approximation at low order, and the full radiative transfer model as the truncation limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. It is therefore possible to tune the precision of the model to the demands of the imaging application, taking $N=1$ for cases when the diffusion approximation would suffice and increasing the number of terms otherwise. We will then utilise the non-linear optimisation functionality of Matlab to address the corresponding large-scale nonlinear inverse problem using gradient based quasi-Newton minimisation via the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Numerical experiments for two test-cases of increasing complexity and resolution will be presented, and the effect of logarithmically rescaling the problem data on the accuracy of the reconstructed solutions will be investigated. We will focus on cases where the diffusion approximation is not sufficient to demonstrate that our approach can provide significant accuracy gains with only a modest increase in the number of Fourier terms included.</details> |

This theorem is a fundamental result, and many investigations have been done to verify its validity for finite difference, finite volume, and finite element schemes, using either explicit or implicit linear time-integration methods. Recently, the use of modified Patankar (MP) schemes as time-integration methods for the discretization of hyperbolic conservation laws has gained increasing interest. These schemes are unconditionally conservative and positivity-preserving and only require the solution of a linear system. However, MP schemes are by construction nonlinear, which is why the theoretical investigation of these schemes is more involved. We prove an extension of the Lax--Wendroff theorem for the class of MP methods. This is the first extension of the Lax--Wendroff theorem to nonlinear time integration methods with just an additional hypothesis on the total time variation boundness of the numerical solutions. We provide some numerical simulations that validate the theoretical observations.</details> |

In this study, we investigate the structural and elastic characteristics of silicene using molecular dynamics simulations based on a tight-binding Hamiltonian, calibrated to align with density-functional theory calculations. We focus particularly on the material's elastic properties and mechanical stability, analyzing its behavior under extensive compressive and tensile in-plane stresses and across temperatures up to 1000 K. Key properties examined include in-plane area, Si--Si bond length, atomic mean-square displacements, elastic constants, and 2D compression modulus. Our findings reveal a notable reduction in stiffness elastic constants, Poisson's ratio, and compression modulus with increasing temperature. Additionally, we identify mechanical instabilities in the silicene structure at specific compressive and tensile biaxial stresses, signaling the material's stability limits or spinodal points. At the corresponding spinodal pressures, structural and elastic properties exhibit anomalies or divergences.</details> |

The TransNet is a two-layer neural network with specially pre-trained hidden-layer neurons. In the proposed MAE-TransNet, the inner and outer solutions produced from the matched asymptotic expansions are first approximated by a TransNet with nonuniform hidden-layer neurons and a TransNet with uniform hidden-layer neurons, respectively. Then, these two solutions are combined with a matching term to obtain the composite solution, which approximates the asymptotic expansion solution of the singular perturbation problem. This process enables the MAE-TransNet method to retain the precision of the matched asymptotic expansions while maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of TransNet. Meanwhile, the rescaling of the sharp region allows the same pre-trained network parameters to be applied to boundary layers with various thicknesses, thereby improving the transferability of the method. Notably, for coupled boundary layer problems, a computational framework based on MAE-TransNet is also constructed to effectively address issues resulting from the lack of relevant matched asymptotic expansion theory in such problems. Our MAE-TransNet is compared with TransNet, PINN, and Boundary-Layer PINN on various benchmark problems including 1D linear and nonlinear problems with boundary layers, the 2D Couette flow problem, a 2D coupled boundary layer problem, and the 3D Burgers vortex problem. Numerical results demonstrate that MAE-TransNet significantly outperforms other neural network methods in capturing the characteristics of boundary layers, improving the accuracy, and reducing the computational cost.</details> |

However, these models remain widely studied as they often yield high-quality, task-oriented solutions, particularly in medical imaging, where the goal is to enhance clinically relevant features rather than merely minimizing global error. We propose incDG, a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning with incremental model-based optimization to efficiently approximate the $\ell_0$ -optimal solution of imaging inverse problems. Built on the Deep Guess strategy, incDG exploits a deep neural network to generate effective initializations for a non-convex variational solver, which refines the reconstruction through regularized incremental iterations. This design combines the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the theoretical guarantees of model-based optimization, ensuring robustness and stability. We validate incDG on TpV-regularized optimization tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in medical image deblurring and tomographic reconstruction across diverse datasets, including synthetic images, brain CT slices, and chest-abdomen scans. Results show that incDG outperforms both conventional iterative solvers and deep learning-based methods, achieving superior accuracy and stability. Moreover, we confirm that training incDG without ground truth does not significantly degrade performance, making it a practical and powerful tool for solving non-convex inverse problems in imaging and beyond.</details> |

Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$ , underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</details> |

We restrict our attention to surfaces without boundary, but allow for spontaneous curvature effects. The axisymmetric setting allows us to formulate our schemes in terms of the generating curve of the considered surface. We propose a novel weak formulation, that combines an evolution equation for the surface's mean curvature and the curvature identity of the generating curve. The mean curvature is used to describe the gradient flow structure, which enables an unconditional stability result for the discrete solutions. The generating curve's curvature, on the other hand, describes the surface's in-plane principal curvature and plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier for an equidistribution property on the discrete level. We introduce two fully discrete schemes and prove their unconditional stability. Numerical results are provided to confirm the convergence, stability and equidistribution properties of the introduced schemes.</details> |

Santana et.al. | [2505.06189](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06189) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Fourier-transform-based methods enable accurate, dispersion-free   simulations of time-domain scattering problems by evaluating   solutions to the Helmholtz equation at a discrete set of   frequencies, sufficient to approximate the inverse Fourier   transform. However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles,   the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex   resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical   inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces   a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that   regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently   computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a   straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a   large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant   complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational   approximation of integral equation solutions at real   frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all   relevant complex resonances are properly identified.</details> |

The proposed approach utilizes the convergent Rayleigh inverse iterative formulation introduced by Abedin and Kitagawa as the prototype. More importantly, it employs an error tolerance criterion of inexact Aleksandrov solutions to approximately solve the subproblems without spoiling the convergence, which becomes the most crucial issue for the efficient implementation of the iterative method. For the two-dimensional case, by properly taking advantage of the flexibility rendered by the proposed inexact approach and a convergent fixed-point-based approach to solve the subproblems, considerable advancements in computational efficiency can be achieved by the inexact AKI method with its convergence under the ${\cal C}^{2,\alpha}$ boundary condition being rigorously established. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed inexact AKI method. The numerical results suggest that the inexact AKI method can be more than eight times faster than the original AKI method, at least for all the tested problems.</details> |

These non-Hermitian degeneracies also called exceptional points (EP) have raised considerable attention in the scientific community as these can have a great impact in a variety of physical problems. The method first requires the computation of high order derivatives of a few selected eigenvalues with respect to each parameter involved. The second step is to recombine these quantities to form new coefficients associated with a partial characteristic polynomial (PCP). By construction, these coefficients are regular functions in a large domain of the parameter space which means that the PCP allows one to recover the selected eigenvalues as well as the localization of high order EPs by simply using standard root-finding algorithms. The versatility of the proposed approach is tested on several applications, from mass-spring systems to guided acoustic waves with absorbing walls and rooms acoustics. The scalability of the method to large sparse matrices arising from conventional discretization techniques such as the finite element method is demonstrated. The proposed approach can be extended to a large number of applications where EPs play an important role in quantum mechanics, optics and photonics or in mechanical engineering.</details> |

In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</details> |
| 2025-05-09 | Unconditionally local bounds preserving numerical scheme based on inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for advection on networks | Peter Frolkovič, Svetlana Krišková, Katarína Lacková et.al. | [2505.06106](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06106) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We derive an implicit numerical scheme for the solution of advection equation where the roles of space and time variables are exchanged using the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure. The scheme contains a linear weight for which it is always second order accurate in time and space, and the stencil in the implicit part is fully upwinded for any value of the weight, enabling a direct computation of numerical solutions by forward substitution. To fulfill the local bounds for the solution represented by the discrete minimum and maximum principle (DMP), we use a predicted value obtained with the linear weight and check a priori if the DMP is valid. If not, we can use either a nonlinear weight or a limiter function that depends on Courant number and apply such a high-resolution version of the scheme to obtain a corrected value. The advantage of the scheme obtained with the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure is that only in the case of too small Courant numbers, the limiting is towards the first order accurate scheme, which is not a situation occurring in numerical simulations with implicit schemes very often. In summary, the local bounds are satisfied up to rounding errors unconditionally for any Courant numbers, and the formulas for the predictor and the corrector are explicit. The high-resolution scheme can be extended straightforwardly for advection with nonlinear retardation coefficient with numerical solutions satisfying the DMP, and a scalar nonlinear algebraic equation has to be solved to obtain each predicted and corrected value. In numerical experiments, including transport on a sewer network, we can confirm the advantageous properties of numerical solutions for several representative examples.</details> |

In contrast, the real eigenvalues are described in terms of the roots of a third-degree polynomial with real coefficients. The results of numerical experiments are reported to show the quality of the theoretical bounds and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners used with GMRES, especially in comparison with similar block diagonal preconditioning strategies along with the MINRES iteration.</details> |

However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</details> |
| 2025-05-09 | On removing orders from amplitude equations | David Juhasz, Per Kristen Jakobsen et.al. | [2505.05915](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05915) |  | 56 pages, 12 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the renormalization group (RG) method and test its numerical accuracy. It has been tested on numerous scalar ODEs and systems of ODEs. Our method is primarily motivated by the possibility of simplifying amplitude equations. The key feature of our method is the introduction of a new homogeneous function at each order of the perturbation hierarchy, which is then used to remove terms from the amplitude equations. We have shown that there is a limit to how many terms can be removed, as doing so beyond a certain point would reintroduce linear growth. There is thus a \textit{core} in the amplitude equation, which consists of the terms that cannot be removed while avoiding linear growth. Using our modified RG method, higher accuracy can also be achieved while maintaining the same level of complexity in the amplitude equation.</details> |

TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$ -variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</details> |

Belosludov et.al. | [2505.05891](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05891) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the structural and elastic properties of 2H-MX $_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (M = W, Mo, Ta, Nb; X = S, Se). Using density functional theory with various van der Waals exchange-correlation functionals, we systematically investigate the influence of nonlocal interactions on lattice parameters, elastic constants, and mechanical moduli. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between semiconducting and metallic TMDs: metallic compounds exhibit larger in-plane lattice parameters and reduced interlayer spacing, consistent with their bonding characteristics. We find that metallic TMDs display significantly lower in-plane stiffness and shear modulus compared to their semiconducting counterparts. We discuss this behaviour in the context of the observed charge density waves. In addition, we establish clear trends in the bulk, Young's, and shear moduli, demonstrating the role of atomic number and chemical composition in determining mechanical stability.</details> |
| 2025-05-09 | Generative Discovery of Partial Differential Equations by Learning from Math Handbooks | Hao Xu, Yuntian Chen, Rui Cao et.al. | [2505.05869](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05869) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However, purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model, called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific discovery.</details> |

| 2025-05-09 | On the Stability Barrier of Hermite Type Discretizations of Advection Equations | Xianyi Zeng et.al. | [2505.05792](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05792) |  | 29 pages, 7 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper we establish a stability barrier of a class of high-order Hermite-type discretization of 1D advection equations underlying the hybrid-variable (HV) and active flux (AF) methods. These methods seek numerical approximations to both cell-averages and nodal solutions and evolves them in time simultaneously. It was shown in earlier work that the HV methods are supraconvergent, providing that the discretization uses more unknowns in the upwind direction than the downwind one, similar to the "upwind condition" of classical finite-difference schemes. Although it is well known that the stencil of finite-difference methods could not be too biased towards the upwind direction for stability consideration, known as "stability barrier", such a barrier has not been established for Hermite-type methods. In this work, we first show by numerical evidence that a similar barrier exists for HV methods and make a conjecture on the sharp bound on the stencil. Next, we prove the existence of stability barrier by showing that the semi-discretized HV methods are unstable given a stencil sufficiently biased towards the upwind direction. Tighter barriers are then proved using combinatorical tools, and finally we extend the analysis to studying other Hermite-type methods built on approximating nodal solutions and derivatives, such as those widely used in Hermite WENO methods.</details> |

Replication Data:   https://doi.org/10.18419/DARUS-4620 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</details> |

The proposed method is motivated by accelerometer-derived physical activity data from the 2011-12 cohort of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), where we are interested in identifying age and race-specific heterogeneity in covariate effects on the diurnal patterns of physical activity across the lifespan. Existing methods for variable selection in function-on-scalar regression have primarily been designed for fixed effect selection and for single-level functional data. In high-dimensional multilevel functional regression, the presence of cluster-specific heterogeneity in covariate effects could be detected through sparsity in fixed and random effects, and for this purpose, we propose a multilevel functional mixed effects selection (MuFuMES) method. The fixed and random functional effects are modelled using splines, with spike-and-slab group lasso (SSGL) priors on the unknown parameters of interest and a computationally efficient MAP estimation approach is employed for mixed effect selection through an Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm. Numerical analysis using simulation study illustrates the satisfactory selection accuracy of the variable selection method in having a negligible false-positive and false-negative rate. The proposed method is applied to the accelerometer data from the NHANES 2011-12 cohort, where it effectively identifies age and race-specific heterogeneity in covariate effects on the diurnal patterns of physical activity, recovering biologically meaningful insights.</details> |

The method relies on the Eulerian flow equations, approximated utilizing a state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method with a dynamic momentum source term to enforce rotor circulation. The method offers substantial computational savings by avoiding near-wall refinement and easing time step constraints, making it ideal for early design phases such as design space exploration. Validation against potential flow theory and viscous reference simulations confirms that the method reliably predicts lift-induced forces despite its limitations in capturing parasitic drag. Three-dimensional simulations, including idealized wind tunnel setups and full-scale ship applications at high Reynolds numbers (up to ReL=1E08), demonstrate that results based on low-order convection featuring a solid numerical viscosity yield deviations with respect to viscous reference data of around O(10%). Accepting this reasonable loss of predictive accuracy provides a simulation framework with response times in the order of minutes compared to hours or even days.</details> |

However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe $_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic temperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$ .</details> |

Our goal is to reconstruct the optical coefficients, i.e., the diffusion and absorption coefficients, using multiple internal observational data. The foundation of our numerical algorithm lies in solving an inverse diffusivity problem and a direct problem associated with elliptic equations. The stability of the inverse problem depends critically on a non-zero condition in the internal observations, a condition that can be met using randomly chosen boundary excitation data. Utilizing these randomly generated boundary data, we implement an output least squares formulation combined with finite element discretization to solve the inverse problem. In this scenario, we provide a rigorous error estimate in $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the numerical reconstruction using a weighted energy estimate, inspired by the analysis of a newly proposed conditional stability result. The resulting error estimate serves as a valuable guide for selecting appropriate regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes according to the noise levels present in the data. Several numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical scheme.</details> |

This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability, band structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm that Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic structure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which is slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from the expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute to the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that Vivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2 eV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive index and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is absorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of Vivianene and highlight its potential for advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and energy-related technologies.</details> |
| 2025-05-08 | A new paradigm for computing hydrodynamic forces on particles in Euler-Lagrange point-particle simulations | Berend van Wachem, Hani Elmestikawy, Akshay Chandran et.al. | [2505.05255](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05255) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic forces on particles is central to the fidelity of Euler-Lagrange (EL) simulations of particle-laden flows. Traditional EL methods typically rely on determining the hydrodynamic forces at the positions of the individual particles from the interpolated fluid velocity field, and feed these hydrodynamic forces back to the location of the particles. This approach can introduce significant errors in two-way coupled simulations, especially when the particle diameter is not much smaller than the computational grid spacing. In this study, we propose a novel force correlation framework that circumvents the need for undisturbed velocity estimation by leveraging volume-filtered quantities available directly from EL simulations. Through a rigorous analytical derivation in the Stokes regime and extensive particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) at finite Reynolds numbers, we formulate force correlations that depend solely on the volume-filtered fluid velocity and local volume fraction, parametrized by the filter width. These correlations are shown to recover known drag laws in the appropriate asymptotic limits and exhibit a good agreement with analytical and high-fidelity numerical benchmarks for single particle cases, and, compared to existing correlations, an improved agreement for the drag force on particles in particle assemblies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the accuracy of hydrodynamic force predictions for both isolated particles and dense suspensions, without incurring the prohibitive computational costs associated with reconstructing undisturbed flow fields. This advancement lays the foundation for robust, scalable, and high-fidelity EL simulations of complex particulate flows across a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.</details> |

Here, we harness machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics to resolve the phase boundary behavior in the KNbO3-KTaO3 (KNTO) system. Our simulations reveal that chemical composition and ordering enable precise modulation of polymorphic phase boundaries (PPBs), offering a versatile pathway for materials engineering. Diffused PPBs and polar nano regions, predicted by our model, highly match with experiments, underscoring the fidelity of the machine-learning atomistic simulation. Crucially, we identify elastic and electrostatic mismatches between ferroelectric KNbO3 and paraelectric KTaO3 as the driving forces behind complex microstructural evolution.

The proposed method combines the semi-analytical capabilities of the SBFEM with the geometric flexibility of polyhedral and octree meshes, making it well-suited for complex seepage problems. Wachspress shape functions are employed to construct shape functions over arbitrary polyhedral elements, enabling accurate approximation along complex boundaries. The method is implemented within the ABAQUS UEL framework to support steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage simulations. A series of numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence of the proposed method, including benchmark problems and geometrically complex domains.

This particular biasedness might not be desirable in applications and can lead to severe challenges when $\mathsf{A}$ is non-injective.   We have therefore, in a series of papers, investigated how to "remedy" this fact, relative to a chosen basis and in a certain mathematical sense: Based on a weighting procedure, it turns out that it is possible to modify both Tikhonov and sparsity regularization such that each member of the chosen basis can be almost perfectly recovered from their image under $\mathsf{A}$. In particular, we have studied this problem for the task of using boundary data to identify the source term in an elliptic PDE. However, this weighting procedure involves $\mathsf{A}^\dagger \mathsf{A}$, where $\mathsf{A}^\dagger$ denotes the pseudo inverse of $\mathsf{A}$, and can thus be CPU-demanding and lead to undesirable error amplification.   We therefore, in this paper, study alternative weighting approaches and prove that some of the recovery results established for the methodology involving $\mathsf{A}$ hold for a broader class of weighting schemes. In fact, it turns out that "any" linear operator $\mathsf{B}$ has an associated proper weighting defined in terms of images under $\mathsf{B}\mathsf{A}$. We also present a series of numerical experiments, employing different choices of $\mathsf{B}$ .</details> |

Moreover, we observe that our formulation does not need any stabilization term in presence of small cut cells and conditioning is not affected by the interface position.</details> |

Pavliotis, Andrea Zanoni et.al. | [2505.05207](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05207) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We consider the problem of inferring the interaction kernel of stochastic interacting particle systems from observations of a single particle. We adopt a semi-parametric approach and represent the interaction kernel in terms of a generalized Fourier series. The basis functions in this expansion are tailored to the problem at hand and are chosen to be orthogonal polynomials with respect to the invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics. The generalized Fourier coefficients are obtained as the solution of an appropriate linear system whose coefficients depend on the moments of the invariant measure, and which are approximated from the particle trajectory that we observe. We quantify the approximation error in the Lebesgue space weighted by the invariant measure and study the asymptotic properties of the estimator in the joint limit as the observation interval and the number of particles tend to infinity, i.e. the joint large time-mean field limit. We also explore the regime where an increasing number of generalized Fourier coefficients is needed to represent the interaction kernel. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations.</details> |

However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</details> |

Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.</details> |

This method achieves second-order accuracy and offers substantial computational advantages over both direct solvers and finite-difference-based multigrid methods. A key strength of the ghost finite element framework is its variational formulation, which naturally enables consistent transfer operators and avoids residual splitting across grid levels. We provide a detailed construction of the multigrid components in both one and two spatial dimensions, including smoothers, transfer operators, and coarse grid operators. The choice of the stabilization parameter plays a crucial role in ensuring well-posedness and optimal convergence of the multigrid method. We derive explicit algebraic expressions for this parameter based on the geometry of cut cells. In the two-dimensional setting, we further improve efficiency by performing additional smoothing exclusively on cut cells, reducing computational cost without compromising convergence. Numerical results validate the proposed method across a range of geometries and confirm its robustness and scalability.</details> |

The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</details> |

Although significantly more work is needed to support a robust assessment in this direction, these results suggest that deep-learning and the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation represent two equivalent, but largely distinct paths to the same physical knowledge. If so, Explainable AI might be an unrealistic target and possibly even an ill-posed one.</details> |
| 2025-05-07 | Duality-Based Algorithm and Numerical Analysis for Optimal Insulation Problems on Non-Smooth Domains | Harbir Antil, Alex Kaltenbach, Keegan L. A. Kirk et.al. | [2505.04571](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04571) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This article develops a numerical approximation of a convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem. The physical problem involves determining the optimal distribution, given by $h\colon \Gamma_I\to [0,+\infty)$, of a given amount $m\in \mathbb{N}$ of insulating material attached to a boundary part $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \in \mathbb{N}$ , subject to conductive heat transfer. To tackle the non-local and non-smooth character of the problem, the article introduces a (Fenchel) duality framework: (a) At the continuous level, using (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a posteriori error identity that can handle arbitrary admissible approximations of the primal and dual formulations of the convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem; (b) At the discrete level, using discrete (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a priori error identity that applies to a Crouzeix--Raviart discretization of the primal formulation and a Raviart--Thomas discretization of the dual formulation. The proposed framework leads to error decay rates that are optimal with respect to the specific regularity of a minimizer. In addition, we prove convergence of the numerical approximation under minimal regularity assumptions. Since the discrete dual formulation can be written as a quadratic program, it is solved using a primal-dual active set strategy interpreted as semismooth Newton method. A solution of the discrete primal formulation is reconstructed from the solution of the discrete dual formulation by means of an inverse generalized Marini formula. This is the first such formula for this class of convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problems.</details> |

However, OFDFT remains limited by the difficulty of formulating accurate kinetic-energy density functionals. In this paper, we substantially enhance the accuracy of OFDFT energies and densities by tuning, during density initialization, the parameter $\mu$ of the APBEK functional, which arises in the second-order gradient expansion of the kinetic energy for semiclassical neutral atoms. We augment this parameterized APBEK functional with two physically-motivated, non-empirical corrections derived from Kato's cusp condition and the virial theorem. The resulting functional, which we call MuAPBEK, is benchmarked against Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) on atoms, organic molecules from the QM9 dataset, and the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. MuAPBEK achieves much lower energy errors than standard APBEK and Thomas-Fermi-von-Weizsacker functionals, even when the latter two are evaluated on converged KSDFT densities. Its mean absolute energy errors on atoms and molecules are 161 and 122 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that MuAPBEK's errors do not scale with system size. MuAPBEK also yields accurate densities, with a mean integrated absolute density error of 1.8 electrons for molecules. Importantly, one step of our density optimization scheme is at least ten times faster than a single KSDFT self-consistent field cycle and exhibits a lower-order computational time complexity of $O(N^{1.96})$ with respect to system size, $N$ . Our results indicate that highly-accurate OFDFT for large-scale quantum simulations beyond the practical limits of KSDFT is within reach.</details> |

Gottwald, Shuigen Liu, Youssef Marzouk et.al. | [2505.04417](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.</details> |

We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate   the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of   degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods.

Our comprehensive evaluation of seven initialization approaches (uniform random, uniform random with rejection, Halton and Sobol sequences, perfect and perturbed lattices, and a Monte Carlo pair distribution method) demonstrates that initialization significantly impacts equilibration efficiency, with microfield distribution analysis providing diagnostic insights into thermal behaviors. Our results establish that initialization method selection is relatively inconsequential at low coupling strengths, while physics-informed methods demonstrate superior performance at high coupling strengths, reducing equilibration time. We establish direct relationships between temperature stability and uncertainties in transport properties (diffusion coefficient and viscosity), comparing thermostating protocols including ON-OFF versus OFF-ON duty cycles, Berendsen versus Langevin thermostats, and thermostat coupling strengths. Our findings demonstrate that weaker thermostat coupling generally requires fewer equilibration cycles, and OFF-ON thermostating sequences outperform ON-OFF approaches for most initialization methods. The methodology implements temperature forecasting as a quantitative metric for system thermalization, enabling users to determine equilibration adequacy based on specified uncertainty tolerances in desired output properties, thus transforming equilibration from a heuristic process to a rigorously quantifiable procedure with clear termination criteria.</details> |

In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that the critical exponents are very close to those of the 2D Ising universality class.</details> |

Accurately modeling this problem presents substantial challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled thermo-poromechanical processes and the frictional contact mechanics of fractures. To resolve process couplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully implicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver to run the model. The solver's efficiency primarily depends on a robust preconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must handle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy, momentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the problem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple the momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to account for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of the contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two variations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy balance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual or the System-AMG approach. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of fluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction and subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the preconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes governed by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclet number. The grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well in terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions.</details> |

The design and optimization of plasma-based accelerators typically require particle-in-cell simulations, which can be computationally intensive and time consuming. In this study, we train a neural network model to obtain the on-axis longitudinal electric field distribution directly without conducting particle-in-cell simulations for designing a two-bunch plasma wakefield acceleration stage. By combining the neural network model with an advanced algorithm for achieving the minimal energy spread, the optimal normalized charge per unit length of a trailing beam leading to the optimal beam-loading can be quickly identified. This approach can reduce computation time from around 7.6 minutes in the case of using particle-in-cell simulations to under 0.1 seconds. Moreover, the longitudinal electric field distribution under the optimal beam-loading can be visually observed. Utilizing this model with the beam current profile also enables the direct extraction of design parameters under the optimal beam-loading, including the maximum decelerating electric field within the drive beam, the average accelerating electric field within the trailing beam and the transformer ratio. This model has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of designing and optimizing the beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators.</details> |

The issue of ensuring the continuity of displacement and slope between elements is addressed by the use of cubic Hermite-type Partition of Unity (PU) functions. With appropriate PU functions, the PUFEM allows the incorporation of the special enrichment functions into the finite elements to better cope with plate oscillations in a broad frequency band. The enrichment strategies consist of the sum of a power series up to a given order and a combination of progressive flexural wave solutions with polynomials. The applicability and the effectiveness of the PUFEM plate elements is first verified via the structural frequency response. Investigation is then carried out to analyze the role of polynomial enrichment orders and enriched plane wave distributions for achieving good computational performance in terms of accuracy and data reduction. Numerical results show that the PUFEM with high-order polynomials and hybrid wave-polynomial combinations can provide highly accurate prediction results by using reduced degrees of freedom and improved rate of convergence, as compared with the classical FEM.</details> |

During the critical phases of epidemics, devising effective intervention measures poses a significant challenge to both the academic and practical arenas. There is numerous research based on reinforcement learning to optimize intervention measures of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, most of these efforts have been confined within the differential equation based on infectious disease models. Although a limited number of studies have incorporated reinforcement learning methodologies into individual-based infectious disease models, the models employed therein have entailed simplifications and limitations, rendering it incapable of modeling the complexity and dynamics inherent in infectious disease transmission. We establish a decision-making framework based on an individual agent-based transmission model, utilizing reinforcement learning to continuously explore and develop a strategy function. The framework's validity is verified through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Covasim, a detailed and widely used agent-based disease transmission model, was modified to support reinforcement learning research. We conduct an exhaustive exploration of the application efficacy of multiple algorithms across diverse action spaces.

It dynamically adjusts the precision for storing vectors and computing, exploiting low precision when appropriate, while maintaining a convergence rate and accuracy comparable to that of double precision PCG. Our mixed precision strategy consists of three main components: (1) The residual and matrix-vector product are initially computed in double precision, and the algorithm switches these to single precision based on the chosen convergence tolerance and an estimate of the residual gap. (2) Depending on the eigenvalue distribution, the preconditioned residual and search direction are either in half precision throughout the iterations or initially in double precision and then stepwise reduced to single and half precision. (3) A dynamically scaled residual is used at every iteration to mitigate underflow in half precision. We provide theoretical support for our estimates and we demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP-PCG through numerical experiments, highlighting both its robustness and the significant performance gains (1.63x speedup) achieved compared to double precision PCG on a GPU.</details> |

The phase field, the velocity field and the pressure field are approximated by conforming linear finite elements, nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants, respectively. When compared with the standard conforming counterpart, the nonconforming FEM can provide an approximation with fewer degrees of freedom, leading to improved computational efficiency. We establish the convergence of the resulting numerical scheme in the sense that the sequences of phase-field functions and discrete velocity fields contain subsequences that converge to a minimizing pair of the continuous problem in the $H^1$ -norm and a mesh-dependent norm, respectively. We present extensive numerical results to illustrate the performance of the approach, including a comparison with the popular Taylor-Hood elements.</details> |

Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift velocity on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</details> |

At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.</details> |

Schnack et.al. | [2505.02670](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02670) |  | 8 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</details> |

To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.</details> |

Bauer et.al. | [2505.02580](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580) |  | This manuscript is also submitted to Measurments Science and   Technology | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$ ). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR_AS_BOA/RBC_PINN.</details> |

By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi $\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</details> |

The variational multiscale method is based on splitting the continuous part of the problem into a resolved scale (coarse scale) and an unresolved scale (fine scale). The unresolved scale (also known as the sub-grid scale) is modeled by choosing it proportional to the component of the residual orthogonal to the finite element space, leading to the orthogonal sub-grid scale (OSGS) method. The idea is then to use the modeled sub-grid scale as an error estimator, considering its contribution in the element interiors and on the edges. We present the results of the a priori analysis and two different strategies for the a posteriori error analysis for the OSGS method. Our proposal is to use a scaled norm of the sub-grid scales as an a posteriori error estimate in the so-called stabilized norm of the problem. This norm has control over the convective term, which is necessary for convection-dominated problems. Numerical examples show the reliable performance of the proposed error estimator compared to other error estimators belonging to the variational multiscale family.</details> |

In this study, we introduce a systematic, task specific node pruning framework that enhances both the efficiency and adaptability of reservoir networks. By identifying and eliminating redundant nodes, we demonstrate that large networks can be compressed while preserving or even improving performance on key computational tasks. Our findings reveal the emergence of optimal subnetwork structures from larger Erdos Renyi random networks, indicating that efficiency is governed not merely by size but by topological organization. A detailed analysis of network structure at both global and node levels uncovers the role of density distributions, special-radius and asymmetric input-output node distributions, among other graph-theoretic measures that enhance the computational capacity of pruned compact networks. We show that pruning leads to non-uniform network refinements, where specific nodes and connectivity patterns become critical for information flow and memory retention. This work offers fundamental insights into how structural optimization influences reservoir dynamics, providing a pathway toward designing more efficient, scalable, and interpretable machine learning architectures.</details> |

The long-time stability and the finite-time error estimate of the numerical solutions are derived for both the semi-discrete-in-space scheme and the fully-discrete scheme. Furthermore, the Leray-Schauder theorem is used to derive the existence and uniqueness of the fully-discrete numerical solutions. Finally, the numerical results verify the theoretical analysis.</details> |

In this paper, we investigate the application of multivariate sampling Kantorovich (SK) operators for image reconstruction, with a particular focus on gap filling and speckle noise reduction. To understand the accuracy performances of the proposed algorithms, we first derive a quantitative estimate in $C(\R^n)$ for the error of approximation using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, which provides sharper error bounds under minimal regularity conditions. We also establish a convergence result and a quantitative estimate with respect to the dissimilarity index measured by the continuous SSIM for functions in Lebesgue spaces. Additionally, we prove a multidimensional linear prediction result, which is used to design a new SK-based reconstruction algorithm to handle missing data, that we call LP-SK algorithm. To address speckle noise, we integrate SK operators into a newly proposed Down-Up scaling approach. Numerical tests are presented on synthetic and real SAR images to validate the proposed methods. Performance is assessed using similarity metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, along with speckle-specific indexes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</details> |

Suffering from the highly coupled nonlinearity, the convergence analysis of the numerical schemes for such a system is rather rare, not to mention the optimal error estimates for the high-order temporally scheme. To this end, we abandon the traditional error analysis method following the process of energy estimate, which may lead to the loss of accuracy. Instead, we note that the charge density also possesses the "energy" decaying property directly derived by its governing equation, although it does not appear in the energy stability analysis. This fact allows us to control the error terms of the charge density more conveniently, which finally leads to the optimal convergence rates. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results, including the energy stability, mass conservation, and convergence rates.</details> |

The method adjusts an existing trigonometric interpolation algorithm such that it can better leverage Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to enhance efficiency. The algorithm can be formulated in a way such that certain cancellation effects can be effectively leveraged for error analysis, which enables us not only to obtain the desired uniform convergent rate of the approximation to a function, but desired uniform convergent rates for its derivatives as well.   We further enhance the algorithm so it can be applied to non-periodic functions defined on bounded intervals. Numerical testing results confirm decent accurate performance of the algorithm. For its application, we demonstrate how it can be applied to estimate integrals and solve linear/non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The test results show that it significantly outperforms Trapezoid/Simpson method on integral and standard Runge-Kutta algorithm on ODE. In addition, we show some numerical evidences that estimation error of the algorithm likely exhibits ``local property", i.e. error at a point tends not to propagate, which avoids significant compounding error at some other place, as a remarkable advantage compared to polynomial-based approximations.</details> |

However, in many practical scenarios, only position measurements are readily available. In this work, we introduce a method to train a standard Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) using only position data, enabled by a theoretical result that permits transforming the Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ into a form $H(q, v)$ . Under certain assumptions, namely, an invertible relationship between momentum and velocity, we formally prove the validity of this substitution and demonstrate how it allows us to infer momentum from position alone. We apply our approach to canonical examples including the spring-mass system, pendulum, two-body, and three-body problems. Our results show that using only position data is sufficient for stable and energy-consistent long-term predictions, suggesting a promising pathway for data-driven discovery of Hamiltonian systems when momentum measurements are unavailable.</details> |
| 2025-05-05 | Optimally accurate operators for partial differential equations | Nobuaki Fuji, Thibault Duretz et.al. | [2505.02320](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02320) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this contribution, we generalize the concept of \textit{optimally accurate operators} proposed and used in a series of studies on the simulation of seismic wave propagation, particularly based on Geller \& Takeuchi (1995). Although these operators have been mathematically and numerically proven to be more accurate than conventional methods, the theory was specifically developed for the equations of motion in linear elastic continuous media. Furthermore, the original theory requires compensation for errors from each term due to truncation at low orders during the error estimation, which has limited its application to other types of physics described by partial differential equations.   Here, we present a new method that can automatically derive numerical operators for arbitrary partial differential equations. These operators, which involve a small number of nodes in time and space (compact operators), are more accurate than conventional ones and do not require meshing. Our method evaluates the weak formulation of the equations of motion, developed with the aid of Taylor expansions.   We establish the link between our new method and the classic optimally accurate operators, showing that they produce identical coefficients in homogeneous media. Finally, we perform a benchmark test for the 1D Poisson problem across various heterogeneous media. The benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to conventional operators, even when using a set of linear B-spline test functions (three-point hat functions). However, the convergence rate can depend on the wavelength of the material property: when the material property has the same wavelength as that of the field, the convergence rate is O(4), whereas it can be less efficient O(2) for other models.</details> |

Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</details> |

For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon.</details> |

This approach has been extended to DNA and RNA sequences, proposing a specific application in the context of reading and translation processes involved in DNA replication and RNA-mediated protein codification. To address the complexity of mapping Liapunov exponents in terms of four parameters representing the different nucleotide bases specialized mapping techniques have been developed. These include Liapunov exponent distributions for entire sequences, as well as binary maps that classify nucleotide bases based on their chemical type (purinic or pyrimidinic). Such methodologies provide a framework for examining the structural and functional properties of genetic material. The sequences analyzed encompass a wide range of DNA and RNA types, including those with and without introns, as well as codifying and noncodifying regions. This multifaceted approach offers valuable insights into the dynamic behavior and stability of nucleotide arrangements, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that govern genetic replication and protein synthesis.</details> |

The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</details> |

Inspired by fictitious domain methods, this method employs a structured mesh to discretize the entire material domain while utilizing separate, independent meshes for the inclusions. These inclusion meshes are coupled to the structured mesh via a substitution matrix, enabling them to act as phantom meshes that do not directly contribute to the final system of equations. This framework offers significant advantages, including enhanced flexibility in handling complex inclusion geometries and improved computational efficiency. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on structures containing inclusions of various geometries. In order to emphasize the efficiency of the PDFEM method, a numerical simulation is presented to highlight its advantages in the case of long natural fibers, such as flax and linen. These simulations are compared against FEM calculations, demonstrating the efficiency of PDFEM. Indeed, meshing such fine structures requires an extremely high number of elements, and in some cases, meshing becomes particularly challenging due to the complexity of the geometries.</details> |

The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\Theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\Theta(x)>0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\Theta(x)<0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\Theta(x)<0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\Theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</details> |

The interpretation of experimental results is often enhanced by parallel numerical studies, which can provide insight and validation for experimental hypotheses. However, developing a theoretical framework for simulating time-resolved spectra remains a significant challenge. The most suitable approach involves the many-body non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which accounts for crucial dynamical many-body correlations during time evolution. While these dynamical correlations are essential for observing emergent behavior in time-resolved spectra, they also render the formalism prohibitively expensive for large-scale simulations. Substantial effort has been devoted to reducing this computational cost -- through approximations and numerical techniques -- while preserving the key dynamical correlations. The ultimate goal is to enable first-principles simulations of time-dependent systems ranging from small molecules to large, periodic, multidimensional solids. In this perspective, we outline key challenges in developing practical simulations for time-resolved spectroscopy, with a particular focus on Green's function methodologies. We highlight a recent advancement toward a scalable framework: the real-time Dyson expansion (RT-DE). We introduce the theoretical foundation of RT-DE and discuss strategies for improving scalability, which have already enabled simulations of system sizes beyond the reach of previous fully dynamical approaches. We conclude with an outlook on future directions for extending RT-DE to first-principles studies of dynamically correlated, non-equilibrium systems.</details> |

We show lower bounds for the $L^p$-error of such methods in the case of approximation at a single point in time or globally in time. On the one hand, we show that for a large class of piecewise Lipschitz continuous drifts and non-additive diffusions the best possible $L^p$-error rate for final time approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $3/4$, which was previously known only for additive diffusions. Moreover, we show that the best $L^p$-error rate for global approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $1/2$ when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally Lipschitz continuous.   For the derivation of the lower bounds we introduce a new method of proof: the local coupling of noise technique. Using this technique when approximating a solution $X$ of the SDE at the final time, a lower bound for the $L^p$-error of any approximation method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion at the points $t_1 < \dots < t_n$ can be determined by the $L^p$-distances of solutions of the same SDE on $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ with initial values $X_{t_{i-1}}$ and driving Brownian motions that are coupled at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ and independent, conditioned on the values of the Brownian motion at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ .</details> |

Inspired by the Schur complement system for elliptic problems, this paper presents a novel substructuring approach to mitigate the potential ill-posedness of local Dirichlet problems for the Helmholtz equation. We propose two types of preconditioners within the framework of nonoverlapping spectral additive Schwarz (NOSAS) methods. The first type of preconditioner focuses on the real part of the Helmholtz problem, while the second type addresses both the real and imaginary components, providing a comprehensive strategy to enhance scalability and reduce computational cost. Our approach is purely algebraic, which allows for adaptability to various discretizations and heterogeneous Helmholtz coefficients while maintaining theoretical convergence for thresholds close to zero. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners, demonstrating robust convergence rates and scalability, even for large wavenumbers.</details> |

These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</details> |

Submitted to Computer Methods in Applied   Mechanics and Engineering | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this work, we apply the space-time Galerkin reduced basis (ST-GRB) method to a reduced fluid-structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hemodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought.</details> |

Bhat et.al. | [2505.00529](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00529) |  | 7 pages, 2 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We derive and implement a second-order adjoint method to compute exact gradients and Hessians for a prototypical quantum optimal control problem, that of solving for the minimal energy applied electric field that drives a molecule from a given initial state to a desired target state. For small to moderately sized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order adjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only marginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used first-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</details> |

It retains the advantages of mesh-free approaches while achieving spectral accuracy for smooth solutions, without the need for iterative procedures. However, the implementation of RFM in the identification of weak solutions remains a subject of limited comprehension, despite crucial role of weak solutions in addressing numerous applied problems. While the direct application of RFM to problems without strong solutions is fraught with potential challenges, we propose an enhancement to the original random feature method that is specifically suited for finding weak solutions and is termed as Weak RFM. Essentially, Weak RFM reformulates the original RFM by adopting the weak form of the governing equations and constructing a new linear system through the use of carefully designed test functions, ensuring that the resulting solution satisfies the weak form by default. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark problems, including challenging three-dimensional cases, and compare its performance with state of the art machine learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that Weak RFM achieves comparable or superior accuracy while significantly reducing computational time and memory consumption, highlighting its potential as a highly efficient and robust tool for finding weak solutions to various PDE problems.</details> |

The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.</details> |

We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</details> |

The algorithm is a least squares algorithm that samples the function at the points of a generated set. We show that there exist $\boldsymbol{\zeta} \in [0,1]^d$ for which the worst-case $L_2$ error has the optimal order of convergence if the space has polynomially converging approximation numbers. In fact, this holds for a significant portion of the generators. Additionally we show that a restriction to rational generators is possible with a slight increase of the bound. Furthermore, we specialise the results to the weighted Korobov space, where we derive a bound applicable to low values of sample points, and state tractability results.</details> |
| 2025-05-01 | Stability of the first-order unified gas-kinetic scheme based on a linear kinetic model | Tuowei Chen, Kun Xu et.al. | [2505.00434](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00434) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is becoming increasingly popular for multiscale simulations in all flow regimes. This paper provides the first analytical study on the stability of the UGKS applied to a linear kinetic model, which is able to reproduce the one-dimensional linear scalar advection-diffusion equation via the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Adopting periodic boundary conditions and neglecting the error from numerical integration, this paper rigorously proves the weighted $L^2$-stability of the first-order UGKS under the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. It is shown that the time step of the method is not constrained by being less than the particle collision time, nor is it limited by parabolic type CFL conditions typically applied in solving diffusion equations. The novelty of the proof lies in that based on the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time, the update of distribution functions is viewed as a convex combinations of sub-methods related to various physics processes, such as the particle free transport and collisions. The weighted $L^2$-stability of the sub-methods is obtained by considering them as discretizations to corresponding linear hyperbolic systems and utilizing the associated Riemann invariants. Finally, the strong stability preserving property of the UGKS leads to the desired weighted $L^2$ -stability.</details> |

By taking the median of $(2r-1)$ independent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) samples, we demonstrate that the desired convergence rates can be achieved without increasing the number of randomizations $r$ as the quadrature size $N$ grows for both bounded and unbounded integrands. For unbounded integrands, our analysis assumes a boundary growth condition on the weak derivatives and also considers singularities such as kinks and jump discontinuities. Notably, when $r = 1$, the median estimator reduces to the standard RQMC estimator. By applying analytical techniques developed for median estimators, we prove that the affine matrix scrambled estimator achieves a convergence rate depending on the integrand's smoothness, and is therefore not limited by the canonical rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-3/2})$ . However, this smoothness-dependent theoretical rate is not observed empirically in numerical experiments when the affine matrix scrambling yields a heavy-tailed sampling distribution. In contrast, the median estimator consistently reveals the theoretical rates and yields smaller integration errors than mean estimators, further highlighting its advantages.</details> |

The results demonstrate that these two metal nanowires follow notably different stress - strain trends, with silver wires exhibiting greater elastic stiffness and higher yield points at equivalent diameters - an effect likely rooted in silver's stronger atomic bonding and more stable microstructure. A pronounced size effect is observed: as the wire diameter diminishes, both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength increase substantially, a behavior driven by the higher proportion of surface atoms that enhance dislocation nucleation and mobility. Atomistic analyses further underscore the dominant role of dislocations during plastic deformation, and in particular reveal that surface - initiated dislocations in thinner wires critically affect their fracture behavior.</details> |

However, accurately modeling their thermal transport properties remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the computational limitations of density functional theory (DFT) and the inaccuracies of classical force fields in non-equilibrium regimes. To address this, we use a recently developed hybrid computational framework that combines machine learning potential (MLP) for intralayer interactions with registry-dependent interlayer potential (ILP) for anisotropic vdW interlayer interaction, achieving near quantum mechanical accuracy. This approach demonstrates exceptional agreement with DFT calculations and experimental data for TMD systems, accurately predicting key properties such as lattice constants, bulk modulus, moir\'e reconstruction, phonon spectra, and thermal conductivities. The scalability of this method enables accurate simulations of TMD heterostructures with large-scale moir\'e superlattices, making it a transformative tool for the design of TMD-based thermal metamaterials and devices, bridging the gap between accuracy and computational efficiency.</details> |

However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strength and twist angle in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.</details> |

This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$ -stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</details> |

With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''</details> |

Koutsourelakis et.al. | [2504.20940](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20940) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.</details> |

The method employs a semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin scheme for spatial discretization of the Vlasov equation, achieving high-order accuracy while removing the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. To ensure energy conservation and eliminate the need to resolve the plasma period, we adopt an energy-conserving time discretization introduced by Liu et al. [J. Comput. Phys., 492 (2023), 112412]. Temporal accuracy is further enhanced through a high-order operator splitting strategy, yielding a method that is high-order accurate in both space and time. The resulting ECSLDG scheme is unconditionally stable and conserves both mass and energy at the fully discrete level, regardless of spatial or temporal resolution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and conservation properties of the proposed method. In particular, the method achieves more accurate enforcement of Gauss's law and improved numerical fidelity over low-order schemes, especially when using a large CFL number.</details> |

The approach combines well-established methods from steam turbine modeling for liquid-phase transitions with cloud microphysics models for ice formation. It resolves homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, interphase momentum exchange, and polydispersed size distributions of droplets, ice crystals, and soot particles. These models are implemented in a parallelized finite-volume solver and applied to a high-bypass turbofan exhaust configuration with simplified geometry. Results indicate that non-equilibrium effects strongly influence condensation and freezing dynamics, while nozzle geometry and water vapor content modulate local supersaturation and phase transition pathways. The findings underscore the limitations of equilibrium-based models and highlight the value of physics-based, scalable tools for analyzing contrail formation across fuels and propulsion systems.</details> |

Its extension to frequency-dependent matrix-valued functions, recently introduced as the ``analytic Bloch-Messiah decomposition" (ABMD), provides the most general approach for characterizing the driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum optical systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians. In this work, we present a detailed study of the ABMD, focusing on the typical behavior of parameter-dependent singular values and of their corresponding singular vectors. In particular, we analyze the hitherto unexplored occurrence of avoided and genuine crossings in the spectrum of quantum noise, the latter being manifested by nontrivial topological Berry phases of the singular vectors. We demonstrate that avoided crossings arise naturally when a single parameter is varied, leading to hypersensitivity of the singular vectors and suggesting the presence of genuine crossings in nearby systems. We highlight the possibility of programming the spectral response of photonic systems through the deliberate design of avoided crossings. As a notable example, we show that such control can be exploited to generate broad, flat-band squeezing spectra -- a desirable feature for enhancing degaussification protocols. This study provides new insights into the structure of multimode quantum correlations and offers a theoretical framework for experimental exploitation of complex quantum optical systems.</details> |

Recently, it was shown in [arXiv:1909.07961v4 (2021)] that for such SDEs the equidistant Euler scheme achieves an $L^p$-error rate of at least $(1+\alpha)/2$, up to an arbitrary small $\varepsilon$, for all $p\geq 1$ and all $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion $W$. In this article we prove a matching lower error bound for $\alpha\in(0, 1)$. More precisely, we show that for every $\alpha\in(0, 1)$, the $L^p$-error rate $(1+\alpha)/2$ of the Euler scheme in [arXiv:1909.07961v4 (2021)] can not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely many evaluations of $W$ at fixed time points. Up to now, this result was known in the literature only for $\alpha=1$.   Additionally, we extend a result from [arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] on sharp lower errror bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with a bounded drift coefficient of fractional Sobolev regularity $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and constant diffusion coefficient at time point $1$. We prove that for every $\alpha\in (0,1)$, the $L^p$-error rate $ (1 + \alpha)/2$ that was shown in [arXiv:2101.12185v2 (2022)] for the equidistant Euler scheme can, up to a logarithmic term, not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely many evaluations of W at fixed time points. This result was known from [arXiv:2402.13732v2 (2024)] only for $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$ and $p=2$ .   For the proof of these lower bounds we use variants of the Weierstrass function as a drift coefficient and we employ the coupling of noise technique recently introduced in [arXiv:2010.00915v1 (2020)].</details> |

In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</details> |

It is well-known that classical methods, such as the finite volume method, suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and that their time step is constrained by a stability condition. The semi-Lagrangian method is known to overcome the stability issue, while recent time-discrete neural network-based approaches overcome the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we propose a novel neural semi-Lagrangian method that combines these last two approaches. It relies on projecting the initial condition onto a finite-dimensional neural space, and then solving an optimization problem, involving the backwards characteristic equation, at each time step. It is particularly well-suited for implementation on GPUs, as it is fully parallelizable and does not require a mesh. We provide rough error estimates, and present several high-dimensional numerical experiments to assess the performance of our approach, and compare it to other neural methods.</details> |

Stochastic rounding requires, in addition to the high-precision input value, a source of random bits. As the provision of high-quality random bits is an additional computational cost, it is of interest to require as few bits as possible while maintaining the desirable properties of SR in a given computation, or computational domain. This paper examines a number of possible implementations of few-bit stochastic rounding (FBSR), and shows how several natural implementations can introduce sometimes significant bias into the rounding process, which are not present in the case of infinite-bit, infinite-precision examinations of these implementations. The paper explores the impact of these biases in machine learning examples, and hence opens another class of configuration parameters of which practitioners should be aware when developing or adopting low-precision floating point.

Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</details> |

First, the regularity of the solution to the considered problem is investigated, finding that its first-order time derivative exhibits singularity at $t=0^+$ and its second-order time derivative shows singularity at both $t=0^+$ and $\tau^+$ , while the solution can be decomposed into its singular and regular components. Then, we derive a fully discrete finite element scheme to solve the considered problem based on the standard Galerkin finite element method in space and the Gr\"unwald-Letnikov type approximation in time. The analysis shows that the developed numerical scheme is stable. In order to discuss the error estimate, a new discrete Gronwall inequality is established. Under the above decomposition of the solution, we obtain a local error estimate in time for the developed numerical scheme. Finally, some numerical tests are provided to support our theoretical analysis.</details> |

The proposed scheme inherits the energy stability from the BGN scheme proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg in 2008, and offers improved mesh quality similar to the minimal deformation rate (MDR) method proposed by Hu and Li in 2022, especially for small time step sizes where the BGN scheme may become unstable and result in deteriorated meshes.</details> |

However, its numerical solution remains computationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and high-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural Spectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the Fourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision operator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves resolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling accurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical validation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator converges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We evaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and hard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The results demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral solvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving the Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.</details> |

Dos Santos et.al. | [2504.20317](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20317) |  | 7 pages,3 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method used for optimization problems. Although not a machine learning method per se, ACO is often employed alongside machine learning models to enhance performance through optimization. We adapt an ACO algorithm to optimize the so-called FVC density functional for the ground-state energy of strongly correlated systems. We find the parameter configurations that maximize optimization efficiency, while reducing the mean relative error ( $MRE$) of the ACO functional. We then analyze the algorithm's performance across different dimensionalities ($1D-5D$), which are related to the number of parameters to be optimized within the FVC functional. Our results indicate that $15$ ants with a pheromone evaporation rate superior to $0.2$ are sufficient to minimize the $MRE$ for a vast regime of parameters of the strongly-correlated system -- interaction, particle density and spin magnetization. While the optimizations $1D$, $2D$, and $4D$ yield $1.5\%< MRE< 2.7\%$, the $3D$ and $5D$ optimizations lower the $MRE$ to $\sim0.8\%$, reflecting a $67\%$ error reduction compared to the original FVC functional ($MRE = 2.4\%$ ). As simulation time grows almost linearly with dimension, our results highlight the potential of ant colony algorithms for density-functional problems, combining effectiveness with low computational cost.</details> |

The LDL factorization is a common tool for factorization of symmetric matrices, and, unlike orthogonal counterparts, generalizes to an arbitrary field. We provide algorithms for dense and sparse LDL factorization and for dense LU factorization that aim to minimize complexity for factorization over a general field. For LU of an $m\times n$ rank $R$ matrix, we obtain an algorithm with complexity $O(mnR^{\omega-2})$, where $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication complexity exponent. For LDL of an $n\times n$ matrix, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n^\omega)$ and for a sparse matrix corresponding to a graph with treewidth $\tau$, we obtain $O(n\tau^{\omega-1})$ . Our sparse LDL algorithm is based on an adaptation of the null-space method for solving saddle point systems of equations, which may be of independent interest.</details> |

We distinguish between two cases: (i) If $F$ is determined by a finite partition of $X$ we derive a lower bound that depends on the dynamical measure-theoretic entropy of the partition. (ii) We consider general finite-dimensional subspaces $F$ and establish a lower bound for the dimension of $F$ that is contingent on the spectral structure of the Koopman operator of the system, via the approximation entropy of $F$ as studied by Voiculescu. Furthermore, we motivate the use of delay observables to improve the predictive qualities of Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms.</details> |

This paper establishes global optimality conditions for general, nonconvex cubic polynomials with quartic regularization. These criteria generalise existing results, recovering the optimality results for regularized quadratic polynomials, and can be further simplified in the low-rank and diagonal tensor cases. Under suitable assumptions on the Taylor polynomial, we derive a lower bound for the regularization parameter such that the necessary and sufficient criteria coincide, establishing a connection between this bound and the subproblem's convexification and sum-of-squares (SoS) convexification techniques. Leveraging the optimality characterization, we develop a Diagonal Tensor Method (DTM) for minimizing quartically-regularized cubic Taylor polynomials by iteratively minimizing a sequence of local models that incorporate both diagonal cubic terms and quartic regularization (DTM model). We show that the DTM algorithm is provably convergent, with a global evaluation complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ . Furthermore, when special structure is present (such as low rank or diagonal), DTM can exactly solve the given problem (in one iteration). In our numerical experiments, we propose practical DTM variants that exploit local problem information for model construction, which we then show to be competitive with cubic regularization and other subproblem solvers, with superior performance on problems with special structure.</details> |

McCalla et.al. | [2504.20256](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20256) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.</details> |

In this work, we develop accurate closed-form approximations for the frequency and anharmonicity of the unimon qubit that are also applicable to any single-mode superconducting qubits with a single-well potential profile, such as the quarton qubit or the kinemon qubit. We use these results to theoretically explore the single-qubit gate fidelity and coherence times across the parameter space of qubits with a single-well potential. We find that the gate fidelity can be optimized by tuning the Hamiltonian to $(i)$ a high qubit mode impedance of $1-2$ $k\Omega$, $(ii)$ a low qubit frequency of $1$ $GHz$, $(iii)$ and a perfect cancellation of the linear inductance and the Josephson inductance attained at a flux bias of half flux quantum. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed qubit parameters have potential to enhance the single-qubit gate fidelity of the unimon beyond $99.99\%$ even without significant improvements to the dielectric quality factor or the flux noise density measured for the first unimon qubits. Furthermore, we compare unimon, transmon and fluxonium qubits in terms of their energy spectra and qubit coherence subject to dielectric loss and $1/f$ flux noise in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of each qubit type.</details> |

However, existing methods lack robustness and often do not achieve the expected advantage over single-level SDC. This work adopts the novel SI time integrators from [44] for enhanced stability and extends the single-level SI-SDC method with a multilevel approach to increase computational efficiency. The favourable properties of the resulting SI-MLSDC method are shown by linear temporal stability analysis for a convection-diffusion problem. The robustness and efficiency of the fully discrete method involving a high-order discontinuous Galerkin SEM discretization are demonstrated through numerical experiments for the convection-diffusion, Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The method is shown to yield substantial reductions in fine-grid iterations compared to single-level SI-SDC across a broad range of test cases. Finally, current limitations of the SI-MLSDC framework are identified and discussed, providing guidance for future improvements.</details> |

Building on the structure of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse) orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis, the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.</details> |

Many important COP classes such as satisfiability (SAT) assume arbitrary interactions between problem variables, while most Ising machines only support pairwise (second-order) interactions. This necessitates translation of higher-order interactions to pair-wise, which typically results in extra variables not corresponding to problem variables, and a larger problem for the Ising machine to solve than the original problem. This in turn can significantly increase time-to-solution and/or degrade solution accuracy. In this paper, considering a representative CMOS-compatible class of Ising machines, we propose a practical design to enable direct hardware support for higher order interactions. By minimizing the overhead of problem translation and mapping, our design leads to up to 4x lower time-to-solution without compromising solution accuracy.</details> |

By employing a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential trained herein, we perform extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the ITC of diamond/cubic boron nitride ( $c$BN) interfaces. The ideal diamond/$c$BN interface exhibits an unprecedented ITC of 11.0 $\pm$ 0.1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, setting a new upper bound for heterostructure interfaces. This exceptional conductance originates from extended phonon modes due to acoustic matching and localized C-atom modes that propagate through B-C bonds. However, atomic diffusion across the ideal interface creates mixing layers that disrupt these characteristic phonon modes, substantially suppressing the thermal transport from its ideal limit. Our findings reveal how interface phonon modes govern thermal transport across diamond/$c$ BN interfaces, providing insights for thermal management in semiconductor devices.</details> |

While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.</details> |

They arise in many different areas, and are particularly important in optimal control of linear quadratic regulators, where they provide the optimal feedback control laws. In the context of control of partial differential equations, these Riccati equations are operator-valued. To approximate their solutions, both spatial and temporal discretizations are needed. While the former have been well analyzed in the literature, there are very few rigorous convergence analyses of time stepping methods applied to DREs, particularly in the infinite-dimensional, operator-valued setting. In view of this, we analyze two numerical time-stepping schemes, the Lie and Strang splitting methods, in such a setting. The analysis relies on the assumption that the uncontrolled system evolves via an operator that generates an analytic semigroup, and that either the initial condition is sufficiently smooth, or the nonlinearity in the DRE is sufficiently smoothing. These assumptions are mild, in the sense that they are not enough to even guarantee continuity in operator-norm of the exact solution to the DRE. However, they imply certain regularity in a pointwise sense, which can be leveraged to prove convergence in operator-norm with the classical orders. The results are illustrated by four numerical experiments, where convergence with the expected order is correlated with the relevant assumptions being fulfilled. The experiments also demonstrate that matrix-valued DREs which arise as spatial discretizations of operator-valued DREs behave similarly, unless the discretization is coarse.</details> |

In order to evaluate the performance of machined components, it is crucial to quantify the uncertainty of the scattering surface. This brings up an important class of inverse scattering problems for random interface reconstruction. In this paper, we present an efficient numerical algorithm for the inverse scattering problem of acoustic-elastic interaction with random periodic interfaces. The proposed algorithm combines the Monte Carlo technique and the continuation method with respect to the wavenumber, which can accurately reconstruct the key statistics of random periodic interfaces from the measured data of the acoustic scattered field. In the implementation of our algorithm, a key two-step strategy is employed: Firstly, the elastic displacement field below the interface is determined by Tikhonov regularization based on the dynamic interface condition; Secondly, the profile function is iteratively updated and optimised using the Landweber method according to the kinematic interface condition. Such a algorithm does not require a priori information about the stochastic structures and performs well for both stationary Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our proposed method.</details> |

In this paper, we propose a self-guided data augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency. Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery, background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</details> |

In the spirit of numerical homogenization, the construction provides low-dimensional coarse approximation spaces that incorporate fine-scale information from the heterogeneous coefficients by solving local patch problems on a fine mesh. The resulting numerical scheme is accompanied by a rigorous error analysis, and it is applicable beyond periodicity and scale-separation in spatial dimensions two and three. In particular, this novel realization circumvents the presence of pollution terms observed in a previous LOD construction for elliptic problems in mixed formulation. Finally, various numerical experiments are provided that demonstrate the performance of the method.</details> |

By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</details> |

The coupled numerical model is implemented entirely within a finite volume-based discretisation framework using a popular computational fluid dynamics C++ toolbox, OpenFOAM. Unlike existing methods for modelling mooring lines, which rely on lumped mass models or finite element-based approaches, this work simulates the mooring cables using non-linear beam models implemented in a finite volume framework to account for bending, tensile, and torsional loading. This advancement makes the current work particularly valuable for simulating extreme sea conditions. The coupled model developed in this study has been validated and verified using experimental and numerical data for a floating box moored with four catenary mooring lines under regular wave conditions featuring different wave heights and periods. The results demonstrate strong agreement with both experimental and numerical data, highlighting the model's accuracy in capturing mooring dynamics and floating body motion.</details> |

In the case of homogeneous media, it has been observed that the iterative solution of the linear system can be accelerated by hybridizing with transmission variables instead of numerical traces, as performed in standard approaches. In this work, we extend the HDG method with transmission variables, which is called the CHDG method, to the heterogeneous case with piecewise constant physical coefficients. In particular, we consider formulations with standard upwind and general symmetric fluxes. The CHDG hybridized system can be written as a fixed-point problem, which can be solved with stationary iterative schemes for a class of symmetric fluxes. The standard HDG and CHDG methods are systematically studied with the different numerical fluxes by considering a series of 2D numerical benchmarks. The convergence of standard iterative schemes is always faster with the extended CHDG method than with the standard HDG methods, with upwind and scalar symmetric fluxes.</details> |

Preconditioning the gradient in the dynamics with the covariance - an idea that originated in literature related to solving estimation and inverse problems using Kalman techniques - results in a mean-field (McKean-Vlasov) SDE. We demonstrate exponential convergence of the time marginal law of the mean-field SDE to the Gibbs measure with non-Gaussian potentials. This extends previous results, obtained in the Gaussian setting, to a broader class of potential functions. We also establish uniform in time bounds on all moments and convergence in $p$ -Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we show convergence of a weak particle approximation, that avoids computing the square root of the empirical covariance matrix, to the mean-field limit. Finally, we prove that an explicit numerical scheme for approximating the particle dynamics converges, uniformly in number of particles, to its continuous-time limit, addressing non-global Lipschitzness in the measure.</details> |
| 2025-04-25 | A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients | Eric T. Chung, Changqing Ye, Xiang Zhong et.al. | [2504.18054](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18054) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</details> |

Unlike previous studies, we consider the bistatic measurement configuration corresponding to the transmitter location and design indicator functions for both a single source and multiple sources, and we convert the unknown measurement data to a fixed nonzero constant. To explain the applicability and limitation of object detection, we demonstrate that the indicator functions can be expressed by an infinite series of Bessel functions, the material properties of the objects, the bistatic angle, and the converted constant. Based on the theoretical results, we explain how the imaging performance of the DSM is influenced by the bistatic angle and the converted constant. In addition, the results of our analyses demonstrate that a smaller bistatic angle enhances the imaging accuracy and that optimal selection of the converted constant is crucial to realize reliable object detection. The results of the numerical simulations obtained using a two-dimensional Fresnel dataset validated the theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the designed indicator functions for small objects.</details> |

The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$ , which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</details> |

First, we apply the OSM with a single source by designing an indicator function based on the asymptotic expansion formula for the scattered field in the presence of small objects. We demonstrate that the indicator function can be expressed by an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind, the range of the signal receiver, and the location of the emitter. Based on this, we then investigate the applicability and limitations of the designed OSM. Specifically, we find that the imaging performance is strongly dependent on the source and the applied frequency. We then apply the OSM with multiple sources to improve imaging performance. Based on the identified structure of the OSM with a single source, we design an indicator function with multiple sources and demonstrate that it can be expressed by an infinite series of the Bessel function of integer order of the first kind, and we explain that objects can be identified uniquely using the designed OSM. Numerical simulation results obtained with the Fresnel experimental dataset demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the OSM with a single source and confirm that the designed OSM with multiple sources improves imaging performance.</details> |

Babyale, Jodi Mead, Donna Calhoun et.al. | [2504.17900](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17900) |  | 32 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables. This paper is under review by the SIAM   Journal on Uncertainty Quantification | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>State estimates from weak constraint 4D-Var data assimilation can vary significantly depending on the data and model error covariances. As a result, the accuracy of these estimates heavily depends on the correct specification of both model and observational data error covariances. In this work, we assume that the data error is known and and focus on estimating the model error covariance by framing weak constraint 4D-Var as a regularized inverse problem, where the inverse model error covariance serves as the regularization matrix. We consider both isotropic and non-isotropic forms of the model error covariance. Using the representer method, we reduce the 4D-Var problem from state space to data space, enabling the efficient application of regularization parameter selection techniques. The Representer method also provides an analytic expression for the optimal state estimate, allowing us to derive matrix expressions for the three regularization parameter selection methods i.e. the L-curve, generalized cross-validation (GCV), and the Chi-square method. We validate our approach by assimilating simulated data into a 1D transport equation modeling wildfire smoke transport under various observational noise and forward model perturbations. In these experiments the goal is to identify the model error covariances that accurately capture the influence of observational data versus model predictions on assimilated state estimates. The regularization parameter selection methods successfully estimate hyperparameters for both isotropic and non-isotropic model error covariances, that reflect whether the first guess model predictions are more or less reliable than the observational data. The results further indicate that isotropic variances are sufficient when the first guess is more accurate than the data whereas non-isotropic covariances are preferred when the observational data is more reliable.</details> |

A fully-mixed formulation of Biot's poroelasticity problem has the advantage of producing a better approximation of the Darcy velocity and stress field, as well as satisfying local mass and momentum conservation. In this work, we focus on a novel four-fields Virtual Element discretization of Biot's equations. The stress symmetry is strongly imposed in the definition of the discrete space, thus avoiding the use of an additional Lagrange multiplier. A complete a priori analysis is performed, showing the robustness of the proposed numerical method with respect to limiting material properties. The first order convergence of the lowest-order fully-discrete numerical method, which is obtained by coupling the spatial approximation with the backward Euler time-advancing scheme, is confirmed by a complete 3D numerical validation. A well known poroelasticity benchmark is also considered to assess the robustness properties and computational performance.</details> |

However, its application has been limited in the study of vapor-to-liquid phase transitions due to the presence of complex liquid dynamics, multiple phases within the same field of view, and experimental difficulty. Here, we develop a calibration framework which is capable to studying one of the most complex two-phase heat transfer processes: dropwise condensation. The framework accounts for non-uniformities arising from dynamic two-phase interactions such as droplet nucleation, growth, coalescence, and departure, as well as substrate effects particularly observed on micro- and nanoengineered surfaces. This approach enables high-resolution temperature measurements with both spatial (12 $\mu$ m) and temporal (5 ms) precision, leading to the discovery of local temperature phenomena unobservable using conventional approaches. These observed temperature variations are linked to droplet statistics, showing how different regions contribute to local condensation heat transfer. We extend the developed method to quantify local thermal parameters by fusing it with a generative machine learning model to map visual images into temperature fields. The model is informed of the physical parameter by incorporating vapor pressure embedding as the conditional parameter. This work represents a significant step toward simplifying local temperature measurements for vapor-to-liquid phase change phenomena by developing a methodology as well as a machine learning approach to map local thermal phenomena using only optical images as the input.</details> |

Building on predictor-corrector framework, our scheme first solves a partially linearized inclusion to produce a predictor \(u_{k+1}\), then incorporates second-order information in a Halley-type corrector step to obtain \(x_{k+1}\). Under metric regularity of the linearization at a reference solution and H\"older continuity of \(f''\), we prove that the iterates converge locally with order \(2+p\) (cubically when \(p=1\)). Moreover, by constructing a suitable scalar majorant function we derive semilocal Kantorovich-type conditions guaranteeing well-definedness and R-cubic convergence from an explicit neighbourhood of the initial guess. Numerical experiments-including one- and two-dimensional test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and illustrate the efficiency of the Josephy-Halley method compared to its Josephy-Newton counterpart.</details> |

The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex cones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions, and the iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices. In this setting, we illustrate that accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain situations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps.</details> |

In the case of large load step, the solution of local nonlinear system to compute the plastic multiplier may not be attained. To overcome this problem, a sub-stepping scheme shall be used to improve the convergence of the local nonlin- ear system solution strategy. Nevertheless, the complexity of the tangent operator of the sub-stepping scheme is high. This complicates the use of Newton-Raphson algorithm to obtain global quadratic convergence. In this paper, a formulation for consistent tangent operator is developed for implicit sub-stepping integration for the modified Cam-Clay model and unified Clay and Sand model. This formulation is highly efficient and can be used with problem involving large load step, such as tun- nel simulation.</details> |

Featuring a number of desirable formal properties over other implementations, we also detail efficiency improvements and a parallelism strategy, resulting in an implementation with a demonstrable similar scaling to an established Hartree--Fock code, with only an order of magnitude increase in cost. We also detail the applicability of a range of self-consistent $GW$ variants within this framework, including a scheme for full self-consistency of all dynamical variables, whilst avoiding the Matsubara axis or analytic continuation, allowing formal convergence at zero temperature. By investigating a range of self-consistency protocols over the GW100 molecular test set, we find that a little-explored self-consistent variant based around a simpler coupled chemical potential and Fock matrix optimization to be the most accurate self-consistent $GW$ approach. Additionally, we validate recently observed evidence that Tamm--Dancoff based screening approximations within $GW$ lead to higher accuracy than traditional random phase approximation screening over these molecular test cases.

However, the periodic pixel structures of display panels introduce significant optical diffraction effects, leading to imaging artifacts and degraded visual quality. Conventional approaches to mitigate these distortions, such as deep learning-based image reconstruction, are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications in consumer electronics. This work introduces an inverse-designed metasurface for wavefront restoration, addressing diffraction-induced distortions without relying on external software processing. The proposed metasurface effectively suppresses higher-order diffraction modes caused by the metallic pixel structures, restores the optical wavefront, and enhances imaging quality across multiple wavelengths. By eliminating the need for software-based post-processing, our approach establishes a scalable, real-time optical solution for diffraction management in UDC systems. This advancement paves the way to achieve software-free real-time image restoration frameworks for many industrial applications.</details> |

The medium above the surface is supposed to be filled with a homogeneous compressible inviscid air/fluid of constant mass density, while the elastic body is assumed to be isotropic and linear. By introducing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators for acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the model is formulated as an acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures. Based on a duality argument, an a posteriori error estimate is derived for the associated truncated finite element approximation. The a posteriori error estimate consists of the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of two different DtN operators, where the latter decays exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Based on the a posteriori error, an adaptive finite element algorithm is proposed for solving the acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</details> |

While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.</details> |

This study proposes a physics-informed approach to feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the context of explainable machine learning.</details> |

This is despite the fact that a comparison of numerical simulations to experimental results is common practice in modern physics research. In this paper we present a simple experiment in thermal diffusion in metal rods. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature difference on the metal rods due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation using the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. Repeating the experiment with only one end of the rod sunk into an aluminum block (the other floating), we get good qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the numerical model. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.</details> |

Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for next-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.</details> |

Colbrook, Catherine Drysdale et.al. | [2504.17012](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17012) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Nonlinear spectral problems arise across a range of fields, including mechanical vibrations, fluid-solid interactions, and photonic crystals. Discretizing infinite-dimensional nonlinear spectral problems often introduces significant computational challenges, particularly spectral pollution and invisibility, which can distort or obscure the true underlying spectrum. We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.</details> |
| 2025-04-23 | Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground States | Jaeuk Kim, Salvatore Torquato et.al. | [2504.16924](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16924) |  | 18 pages, 9 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$ , which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.</details> |

Iglesias, Daniel Walter et.al. | [2504.16899](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16899) |  | 23 pages, 6 Figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce a fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient method for convex minimization problems involving total variation regularization on multidimensional domains. It relies on alternating between updating an active set of subsets of the spatial domain as well as of an iterate given by a conic combination of the associated characteristic functions. Different to previous approaches in the same spirit, the computation of a new candidate set only requires the solution of one prescribed mean curvature problem instead of the resolution of a fractional minimization task analogous to finding a generalized Cheeger set. After discretization, the former can be realized by a single run of a graph cut algorithm leading to significant speedup in practice. We prove the global sublinear convergence of the resulting method, under mild assumptions, and its asymptotic linear convergence in a more restrictive two-dimensional setting which uses results of stability of surfaces of prescribed curvature under perturbations of the curvature. Finally, we numerically demonstrate this convergence behavior in some model PDE-constrained minimization problems.</details> |

Unconditional generation with diffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation through conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P $_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and defects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</details> |

This study introduces a novel mathematical model for open membranes immersed in Stokes flows, accounting for membrane elasticity, line tension at the open edge, and fluid-membrane interactions. The model is derived from an energy functional that incorporates Helfrich bending energy and a line energy associated with the open edge. By balancing dissipation in both the bulk fluid and the membrane surface, following the maximal dissipation principle, we derive the governing equations within an energy variational framework. Assuming axisymmetry and employing a boundary integral reduction, we transform the 3D problem into an effectively 1D problem, for which we develop a finite element-based numerical method to solve the resulting moving boundary problem. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the model and compare the results with existing studies.</details> |

Applications to several different PDE models demonstrate the universality of our method. In addition, we analyze the nonlinearity of the correlated model, revealing a surprising tangential cone condition-like structure, thereby advancing the state of the art towards a convergence guarantee for regularized reconstruction in passive imaging.</details> |

The start point is to set up the representations of $z^\alpha$ and $z^\alpha\log z$ in the slit disk and develop results akin to Paley-Wiener theorem, from which, together with the Poisson summation formula, the root-exponential convergence of the lightning plus polynomial scheme with an exact order for each clustered parameter is established in approximation of prototype functions $g(z)z^\alpha$ or $g(z)z^\alpha\log z$ on a sector-shaped domain, which includes $[0,1]$ as a special case. In addition, the fastest convergence rate is confirmed based upon the best choice of the clustered parameter. Furthermore, the optimal choice of the clustered parameter and the convergence rate for corner singularity problems in solving Laplace equations are attested based on Lehman and Wasow's study of corner singularities and along with the decomposition of Gopal and Trefethen. The thorough analysis provides a solid foundation for lightning schemes and rational approximation. Ample numerical evidences demonstrate the optimality and sharpness of the estimates.</details> |

Rocha et.al. | [2504.16713](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16713) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>There is a high interest in accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. Creating a large training dataset encompassing all relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the computational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor. Commonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain. Here, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast probabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts back to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not required to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a significant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating phases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These phases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty. When the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a local transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a highly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to achieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field model to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for the phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate multiscale simulations.</details> |

This is done mainly by solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using the split step algorithm. In a nonlinear media, dispersive effects exist simultaneously with nonlinear effects. Refractive index dependence on intensity results in optical Kerr effect which causes narrowing of transmitted pulses by inducing self-phase modulation while second order group velocity dispersion causes the pulses to spread. In this project, group velocity dispersion is discussed followed by self-phase modulation. These individually detrimental effects are shown to combine beneficially for propagation of pulses here. Gaussian pulse is studied and propagated by using them as input in to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The split step algorithm is described in depth. Explanation of each step is included along with the relevant equations defining these steps.</details> |

The discrete ansatz space includes degrees of freedom in $n-2$ dimensional submanifolds (e.g., nodal values in 2D and edge values in 3D), in addition to the typical degrees of freedom in the mesh and on the hyperfaces in the HHO literature. This approach enables the characteristic commuting property of the hybrid high-order methodology in any space dimension and allows for lower eigenvalue bounds of higher order for the eigenvalue problem. The main results are quasi-best approximation estimates as well as reliable and efficient error control. The latter motivates an adaptive mesh-refining algorithm that empirically recovers optimal convergence rates for singular solutions.</details> |

Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved results by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with measurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is presented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of the implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds.</details> |

However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.</details> |

We first employ the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator to truncate the physically unbounded domain into a computable bounded domain. This transformation reduces the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain to a boundary value problem within the bounded domain. To solve this boundary value problem, we design a neural network with a subspace layer, where each neuron in this layer represents a basis function. Consequently, the approximate solution can be expressed by a linear combination of these basis functions. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative alternating optimization technique which alternately updates the basis functions and their linear combination coefficients respectively by training and least squares methods. In our method, we set the coefficients of basis functions to 1 and use a new loss function each time train the subspace. These innovations ensure that the subspace formed by these basis functions is truly optimized. We refer to this method as the alternately-optimized subspace method based on neural networks (AO-SNN). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method can significantly reduce the relative $l^2$ error to $10^{-7}$ or lower, outperforming existing machine learning-based methods to the best of our knowledge.</details> |

We demonstrate the benefits of active set algorithms for automated data-driven feature selection. The proposed methods are implemented within the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. Computational tests conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets indicate that sparse ACE models consistently enhance computational efficiency, generalization accuracy and interpretability over dense ACE models. An added benefit of the proposed algorithms is that they produce entire paths of models with varying cost/accuracy ratio.</details> |

Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</details> |

Our target is the Cascadia subduction zone, with one billion parameters. Computing the posterior mean alone would require 50 years on a 512 GPU machine. Instead, exploiting the shift invariance of the parameter-to-observable map and devising novel parallel algorithms, we induce a fast offline-online decomposition. The offline component requires just one adjoint wave propagation per sensor; using MFEM, we scale this part of the computation to the full El Capitan system (43,520 GPUs) with 92% weak parallel efficiency. Moreover, given real-time data, the online component exactly solves the Bayesian inverse and forecasting problems in 0.2 seconds on a modest GPU system, a ten-billion-fold speedup.</details> |

The complexity of noisy quantum systems is even greater, requiring $2^n \times 2^n$-dimensional density matrices. Various approximations reduce density matrix overhead, including quantum trajectory-based methods, which instead use an ensemble of $m \ll 2^n$ noisy states. While this method is dramatically more efficient, current implementations use unoptimized sampling, redundant state preparation, and single-shot data collection. In this manuscript, we present the Pre-Trajectory Sampling technique, increasing the efficiency and utility of trajectory simulations by tailoring error types, batching sampling without redundant computation, and collecting error information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both a mature statevector simulation of a 35-qubit quantum error-correction code and a preliminary tensor network simulation of 85 qubits, yielding speedups of up to $10^6$x and $16$ x, as well as generating massive datasets of one trillion and one million shots, respectively.</details> |

We starting with an overview of the key physical characteristics of lipid bilayers, including their composition, mechanical properties, and thermodynamics, and then discuss continuum models of multi-component bilayers. The most complex model is a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard (NSCH) type system, describing the coupling of incompressible surface fluid dynamics with phase-field dynamics on arbitrarily curved geometries. It is discretized using trace finite element methods, which offer geometric flexibility and stability in representing surface PDEs. Numerical studies are conducted to examine physical features such as coarsening rates and interfacial dynamics. The computational results obtained from the NSCH model are compared against experimental data for membrane compositions with distinct phase behaviors, demonstrating that including both phase-field models and surface hydrodynamics is essential to accurately reproduce domain evolution observed in epi-fluorescence microscopy. Lastly, we extend the model to incorporate external forces that enable the simulation of vesicles containing cationic lipids, used to enhance membrane fusion.</details> |

The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking methods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution discontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers, functioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of $r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual with respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the grid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are proposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render stabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and modifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is used to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1) lessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers, (2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with the given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a majority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A series of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves viscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux profiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$ -adaptation with a high-order discretization.</details> |

We use mixture theory. The mixture's constituents are assumed to be incompressible in their pure form. We use Hamilton's principle to obtain the governing equations, and we propose a corresponding finite element implementation. The filtration velocity and the pore pressure are allowed to be discontinuous across the interface while some control of these discontinuities is built into the interfacial constitutive behavior. To facilitate the practical implementation of the formulation in a finite element scheme, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field over the interface for the explicit enforcement of the jump condition of the balance of mass. Our formulation appears to recover some basic results from the literature. The novelty of the work is the formulation of an approach that can accommodate specific constitutive assumptions pertaining to the behavior of the interface that do not necessarily imply the continuity of the filtration velocity and/or of the pore pressure across it.</details> |

The proposed scheme used the couple pressure and momentum, equal to the density times the velocity, as primary unknowns. It also involves an adequate treatment of the diffusive operator such that treating the nonlinear convective term explicitly leads to a scheme with time independent stiffness matrices that is suitable for pseudo-spectral methods. The stability and temporal convergence of the semi-implicit version of the scheme is established under the hypothesis that the density is approximated with a method that conserves the minimum-maximum principle. Numerical illustrations confirm that both the semi-implicit and explicit scheme are stable and converge with order one under classic CFL condition. Moreover, the proposed scheme is shown to perform better than a momentum based pressure projection method, previously introduced by one of the authors, on setups involving gravitational waves and immiscible multi-fluids in a cylinder.</details> |

In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.</details> |

The investigated approaches include the Sobol global sensitivity analysis, the local sensitivity method for input pixel perturbations and the activation maximization technique. As examples, in this study we consider a small feedforward neural network for analyzing an open tabular dataset of clinical diabetes data, as well as two classical convolutional architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-18, which are widely used in image processing and classification. Utilization of the global sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the leading input parameters of the chosen tiny neural network and reduce their number without significant loss of the accuracy. As far as global sensitivity analysis is not applicable to larger models we try the local sensitivity analysis and activation maximization method in application to the convolutional neural networks. These methods show interesting patterns for the convolutional models solving the image classification problem. All in all, we compare the results of the activation maximization method with popular Grad-CAM technique in the context of ultrasound data analysis.</details> |

Ng, Junjun Pan et.al. | [2504.15073](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15073) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we study Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz matrices generated by quaternion-valued functions. We show that such generating function must be the sum of a real-valued function and an odd function with imaginary component. This setting is different from the case of Hermitian complex Toeplitz matrices generated by real-valued functions only. By using of 2-by-2 block complex representation of quaternion matrices, we give a quaternion version of Grenander-Szeg\"{o} theorem stating the distribution of eigenvalues of Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz matrices in terms of its generating function. As an application, we investigate Strang's circulant preconditioners for Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz linear systems arising from quaternion signal processing. We show that Strang's circulant preconditioners can be diagionalized by discrete quaternion Fourier transform matrices whereas general quaternion circulant matrices cannot be diagonalized by them. Also we verify the theoretical and numerical convergence results of Strang's circulant preconditioned conjugate gradient method for solving Hermitian quaternion Toeplitz systems.</details> |

In particular, some tools have been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a standard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex proteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between atoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of identical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a solvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding the optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering schemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular configurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By considering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an automated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The program capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems ranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in different solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different parameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the representativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical properties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to cluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond solute-solvent systems.</details> |

AMG is an efficient iterative solver for large-scale sparse linear systems, particularly those derived from elliptic and parabolic PDE discretizations. However, its performance heavily relies on numerous parameters, which are often set empirically and are highly sensitive to AMG's effectiveness. Traditional parameter optimization methods are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical support. To address this, we propose a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based strategy to optimize AMG parameters and introduce evaluation metrics to assess their effectiveness. Trained on small-scale datasets, GPR predicts nearly optimal parameters, bypassing the time-consuming parameter sweeping process. We also use kernel learning techniques to build a kernel function library and determine the optimal kernel function through linear combination, enhancing prediction accuracy. In numerical experiments, we tested typical PDEs such as the constant-coefficient Poisson equation, variable-coefficient Poisson equation, diffusion equation, and Helmholtz equation. Results show that GPR-predicted parameters match grid search results in iteration counts while significantly reducing computational time. A comprehensive analysis using metrics like mean squared error, prediction interval coverage, and Bayesian information criterion confirms GPR's efficiency and reliability. These findings validate GPR's effectiveness in AMG parameter optimization and provide theoretical support for AMG's practical application.</details> |
| 2025-04-21 | Enhanced Data-driven Topology Design Methodology with Multi-level Mesh and Correlation-based Mutation for Stress-related Multi-objective Optimization | Jun Yang, Shintaro Yamasaki et.al. | [2504.14790](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14790) |  | 23 pages, 22 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Topology optimization (TO) serves as a widely applied structural design approach to tackle various engineering problems. Nevertheless, sensitivity-based TO methods usually struggle with solving strongly nonlinear optimization problems. By leveraging high capacity of deep generative model, which is an influential machine learning technique, the sensitivity-free data-driven topology design (DDTD) methodology is regarded as an effective means of overcoming these issues. The DDTD methodology depends on initial dataset with a certain regularity, making its results highly sensitive to initial dataset quality. This limits its effectiveness and generalizability, especially for optimization problems without priori information. In this research, we proposed a multi-level mesh DDTD-based method with correlation-based mutation module to escape from the limitation of the quality of the initial dataset on the results and enhance computational efficiency. The core is to employ a correlation-based mutation module to assign new geometric features with physical meaning to the generated data, while utilizing a multi-level mesh strategy to progressively enhance the refinement of the structural representation, thus avoiding the maintenance of a high degree-of-freedom (DOF) representation throughout the iterative process. The proposed multi-level mesh DDTD-based method can be driven by a low quality initial dataset without the need for time-consuming construction of a specific dataset, thus significantly increasing generality and reducing application difficulty, while further lowering computational cost of DDTD methodology. Various comparison experiments with the traditional sensitivity-based TO methods on stress-related strongly nonlinear problems demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method.</details> |

Building on the error analysis by Kazashi and Sloan, we prove the existence of unshifted rank-1 lattice rules that achieve a worst-case error of $O(n^{-1/4}(\log n)^{1/2})$ , with the implied constant independent of the dimension, under certain summability conditions on the weights. Although this convergence rate is inferior to the one achievable for the shifted-averaged root mean squared worst-case error, the result does not rely on random shifting or transformation and holds unconditionally without any conjecture, as assumed by Kazashi and Sloan.</details> |

Zhang, Enrico Riccardi et.al. | [2504.14722](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14722) |  | Preprint | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</details> |

However, traditional model order reduction techniques like balanced truncation are not designed to handle tensor data directly and instead require unfolding the data, which may lead to the loss of important higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for data-driven model order reduction of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), which are often used to capture the evolution of third-order tensor data such as images and videos through the T-product. Specifically, we develop advanced T-product-based techniques, including T-balanced truncation, T-balanced proper orthogonal decomposition, and the T-eigensystem realization algorithm for input-output TPDSs by leveraging the unique properties of T-singular value decomposition. We demonstrate that these techniques offer significant memory and computational savings while achieving reduction errors that are comparable to those of conventional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further validated through synthetic and real-world examples.</details> |

While standard nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) approaches fix the forcing and measure the average induced flux in the system driven out of equilibrium, the so-called ``stochastic Norton dynamics'' instead fixes the value of the flux and measures the average magnitude of the forcing needed to induce it. We extend recent results obtained in Langevin dynamics to consider the generalisation of the stochastic Norton dynamics in the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) at mesoscales, important for a wide range of complex fluids and soft matter applications. We demonstrate that the responses profiles for both the NEMD and stochastic Norton dynamics approaches coincide in both linear and nonlinear regimes, indicating that the stochastic Norton dynamics can indeed act as an alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients, including the mobility and the shear viscosity, as the NEMD dynamics. In addition, based on the linear response of the DPD system with small perturbations, we derive a closed-form expression for the shear viscosity, and numerically validate its effectiveness with various types of external forces. Moreover, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the stochastic Norton dynamics approach clearly outperforms the NEMD dynamics in controlling the asymptotic variance, a key metric to measure the associated computational costs, particularly in the high friction limit.</details> |

The new machine learning SGS model consists of two parts: a classification model used to distinguish regions with either strong energy cascade or energy backscatter from those with mild TKE transfer and a regression model used to calculate SGS stresses in regions with strong TKE transfer. To ease model implementation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers, the Smagorinsky model with a signed coefficient $C_s$, where a positive value indicates energy cascade while a negative one indicates energy backscatter, is employed as the carrier of the machine learning model. To improve its robustness and generality, both physical invariance and geometric invariance features of turbulent flows are embedded into the model input for classification and regression, and the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient is used as the output of the regression model. Different machine-learning methods and input setups have been used to test the classification model's performance. The F1-scores, which measure balanced precision and recall of a model, of the classification models with physical and geometric invariance embedded can be improved by about $17\%$ over those without considering geometric invariance. Regression models based on ensemble neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in predicting the signed Smagorinsky model coefficient, exceeding that of the dynamic Smagorinsky model in $\textit{a priori}$ tests.</details> |

The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.</details> |

Herrmann et.al. | [2504.14405](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14405) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Underground energy storage, which includes storage of hydrogen, compressed air, and CO2, requires careful monitoring to track potential leakage pathways, a situation where time-lapse seismic imaging alone may be inadequate. A recently developed Digital Shadow (DS) enhances forecasting using machine learning and Bayesian inference, yet their accuracy depends on assumed rock physics models, the mismatch of which can lead to unreliable predictions for the reservoir's state (saturation/pressure). Augmenting DS training with multiple rock physics models mitigates errors but averages over uncertainties, obscuring their sources. To address this challenge, we introduce context-aware sensitivity analysis inspired by amortized Bayesian inference, allowing the DS to learn explicit dependencies between seismic data, the reservoir state, e.g., CO2 saturation, and rock physics models. At inference time, this approach allows for real-time ''what if'' scenario testing rather than relying on costly retraining, thereby enhancing interpretability and decision-making for safer, more reliable underground storage.</details> |

The common application of a kernel estimator for a conditional expectation in the calibration condition results in a McKean-Vlasov (MV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) with non-standard coefficients. The primary challenges lie in certain mean-field terms in the drift and diffusion coefficients and the $1/2$-H\"{o}lder regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We establish the well-posedness of this equation for a fixed but arbitrarily small bandwidth of the kernel estimator. Moreover, we prove a strong propagation of chaos result, ensuring convergence of the particle system under a condition on the Feller ratio and up to a critical time. For the numerical simulation, we employ an Euler-Maruyama scheme for the log-spot process and a full truncation Euler scheme for the CIR volatility process. Under certain conditions on the inputs and the Feller ratio, we prove strong convergence of the Euler-Maruyama scheme with rate $1/2$ in time, up to a logarithmic factor. Numerical experiments illustrate the convergence of the discretisation scheme and validate the propagation of chaos in practice.</details> |

However, the algebraic complexity of surface-surface intersections makes gaps and overlaps between surfaces difficult to avoid for in-the-wild surface models. By considering this problem through the lens of the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape, we can define a containment query that is robust to model watertightness. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN on arbitrary curved surfaces would require some form of geometric discretization, potentially inducing containment misclassifications near boundary components. In contrast, our proposed method computes an accurate GWN directly on the curved geometry of the input model. We accomplish this using a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral using Stokes' theorem, which in turn permits an efficient adaptive quadrature calculation on the boundary and trimming curves of the model. While this is sufficient for "far-field" query points that are distant from the surface, we augment this approach for "near-field" query points (i.e., within a bounding box) and even those coincident to the surface patches via a strategy that directly identifies and accounts for the jump discontinuity in the scalar field. We demonstrate that our method of evaluating the GWN field is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. Furthermore, the derived containment query is robust to non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</details> |

Jaiman et.al. | [2504.11433](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11433) |  | 30 pages, 14 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we present a physics-based deep learning framework for data-driven prediction of wave propagation in fluid media. The proposed approach, termed Multistep Integration-Inspired Attention (MI2A), combines a denoising-based convolutional autoencoder for reduced latent representation with an attention-based recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory cells for time evolution of reduced coordinates. This proposed architecture draws inspiration from classical linear multistep methods to enhance stability and long-horizon accuracy in latent-time integration. Despite the efficiency of hybrid neural architectures in modeling wave dynamics, autoregressive predictions are often prone to accumulating phase and amplitude errors over time. To mitigate this issue within the MI2A framework, we introduce a novel loss decomposition strategy that explicitly separates the training loss function into distinct phase and amplitude components. We assess the performance of MI2A against two baseline reduced-order models trained with standard mean-squared error loss: a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network and a variant using Luong-style attention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MI2A model, we consider three benchmark wave propagation problems of increasing complexity, namely one-dimensional linear convection, the nonlinear viscous Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Our results demonstrate that the MI2A framework significantly improves the accuracy and stability of long-term predictions, accurately preserving wave amplitude and phase characteristics. Compared to the standard long-short term memory and attention-based models, MI2A-based deep learning exhibits superior generalization and temporal accuracy, making it a promising tool for real-time wave modeling.</details> |

Contrary to the typically water-rich T Tauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be water-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In this letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other oxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously reported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water emission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source, and we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the MINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules. We show that the $\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for sources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission in such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs. hydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in the disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O$>$ 1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T Tauri disks.</details> |

Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications involving physical systems.</details> |

This paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and derefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster. For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of magnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity procedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions. In essence, the adaptivity technique presented in this paper is positioned as a powerful tool for simulating compressible flows with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.</details> |

The nonlinear system of discrete equations at each physical timestep is solved by using a dual time-stepping technique. The proposed scheme is provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving and provides unconditional stability properties in the physical time. Numerical results demonstrating accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new dual time-stepping scheme are presented for supersonic viscous flows with strong shock waves and contact discontinuities.</details> |

Using odor fields from direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that heterogeneous groups, with exploratory and exploitative agents, consistently outperform homogeneous swarms where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is managed at the individual level. Our results reveal that policy diversity enables the group to reach the odor source more efficiently by mitigating the detrimental effects of spatial correlations in the signal. These findings provide new insights into collective search behavior in biological systems and offer promising strategies for the design of robust, bioinspired search algorithms in engineered systems.</details> |

The observed desorption results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the binding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML (approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface interactions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.</details> |

The degree of entanglement can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and dimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness coefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently, we demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by constructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five.</details> |

To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</details> |

Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.</details> |

Sameh et.al. | [2504.11167](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11167) |  | 26 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The SPIKE family of linear system solvers provides parallelism using a block tridiagonal partitioning. Typically SPIKE-based solvers are applied to banded systems, resulting in structured off-diagonal blocks with non-zeros elements restricted to relatively small submatrices comprising the band of the original matrix. In this work, a low-rank SVD based approximation of the off-diagonal blocks is investigated. This produces a representation which more effectively handles matrices with large, sparse bands. A set of flexible distributed solvers, the LR-SPIKE variants, are implemented. There are applicable to a wide range of applications -- from use as a "black-box" preconditioner which straightforwardly improves upon the classic Block Jacobi preconditioner, to use as a specialized "approximate direct solver." An investigation of the effectiveness of the new preconditioners for a selection of SuiteSparse matrices is performed, particularly focusing on matrices derived from 3D finite element simulations. In addition, the SPIKE approximate linear system solvers are also paired with the FEAST eigenvalue solver, where they are shown to be particularly effective due to the former's rapid convergence, and the latter's acceptance of loose linear system solver convergence, resulting in a combination which requires very few solver iterations.</details> |
| 2025-04-15 | An Unsupervised Network Architecture Search Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations | Qing Li, Jingrun Chen et.al. | [2504.11140](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11140) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in scientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has three main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer. While the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of solution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc, leaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an unsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed PINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to find the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural networks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture parameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of PINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our approach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior usage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as the associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on several benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers' equations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS achieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting observation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a prominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that architectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior performance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.</details> |

The most salient feature of the new approach is that the space and time discrete equations of the numerical method can be obtained as the optimality conditions of a single incremental potential. The governing equations define a gradient flow of the mass in the domain that maximizes the stiffness of the proposed solid, while exactly preserving the mass of the allocated material. Moreover, we propose a change of variables in the model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible bounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow. The proposed strategy results in a robust and efficient topology optimization method that is exactly mass-preserving, does not employ Lagrange multipliers, and is fully variational.</details> |
| 2025-04-16 | Dynamical errors in machine learning forecasts | Zhou Fang, Gianmarco Mengaldo et.al. | [2504.11074](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11074) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between predictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.   Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine learning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine learning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in applications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.   In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ( $d$), and the inverse persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors -- e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity) and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.</details> |

This indicator depends solely on the cell-average data of the target cell and its immediate neighbours. Once the troubled-cells are identified, we apply the limiter only in these cells instead of applying in all computational cells. We introduce a novel technique to quantify the quality of the solution in the neighbourhood of the shock by defining a monotonicity parameter $\mu$ . Numerical results from various two-dimensional simulations on the hyperbolic systems of Euler equations using a finite volume solver employing MUSCL reconstruction validate the performance of the troubled-cell indicator and the approach of limiting only in the troubled-cells. These results show that limiting only in the troubled-cells is preferable to limiting everywhere as it improves convergence without compromising on the solution accuracy.</details> |

This work addresses a novel hybrid algorithm that models the close coupling between compressible flows and deformable materials using a mesoscopic approach. Specifically, the high-speed flows are described by the gas-kinetic scheme, which is a robust Navier-Stokes alternative solver built on the molecular kinetic theory. The deformation, damage, and fracture of materials are depicted using the bond-based peridynamics, which serves as coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct non-local extensions of classical continuum mechanics. The evolution of fluids and materials are closely coupled using the ghost-cell immersed boundary method. Within each time step, the solutions of flow and solid fields are updated simultaneously, and physics-driven boundary conditions are exchanged for each other via ghost cells. Extensive numerical experiments, including crack propagation in a pre-cracked plate, subsonic flow around the NACA0012 airfoil, supersonic flow around the circular cylinder, and shock wave impacting on the elastic panel, are performed to validate the algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the unique advantages of current hybrid algorithm in solving fracture propagation induced by high-speed flows.</details> |

Such operators can arise from the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), and are used in many simulation-based outer-loop tasks in science and engineering, such as PDE-constrained optimization, Bayesian inverse problems, and optimal experimental design. In these settings, the neural network approximations can be used as surrogate models to accelerate the solution of the outer-loop tasks. However, since outer-loop tasks in infinite dimensions often require knowledge of the underlying geometry, the approximation accuracy of the operator's derivatives can also significantly impact the performance of the surrogate model. Motivated by this, we analyze the approximation errors of neural operators in Sobolev norms over infinite-dimensional Gaussian input measures. We focus on the reduced basis neural operator (RBNO), which uses linear encoders and decoders defined on dominant input/output subspaces spanned by reduced sets of orthonormal bases. To this end, we study two methods for generating the bases; principal component analysis (PCA) and derivative-informed subspaces (DIS), which use the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance of the data or the derivatives as the reduced bases, respectively. We then derive bounds for errors arising from both the dimension reduction and the latent neural network approximation, including the sampling errors associated with the empirical estimation of the PCA/DIS. Our analysis is validated on numerical experiments with elliptic PDEs, where our results show that bases informed by the map (i.e., DIS or output PCA) yield accurate reconstructions and generalization errors for both the operator and its derivatives, while input PCA may underperform unless ranks and training sample sizes are sufficiently large.</details> |

A key challenge in working with GMMs is defining a computationally efficient and geometrically meaningful metric. The mixture Wasserstein (MW) distance adapts the Wasserstein metric to GMMs and has been applied in various domains, including domain adaptation, dataset comparison, and reinforcement learning. However, its high computational cost -- arising from repeated Wasserstein distance computations involving matrix square root estimations and an expensive linear program -- limits its scalability to high-dimensional and large-scale problems. To address this, we propose multiple novel slicing-based approximations to the MW distance that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving key optimal transport properties. From a theoretical viewpoint, we establish several weak and strong equivalences between the introduced metrics, and show the relations to the original MW distance and the well-established sliced Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating computational efficiency and applications in clustering, perceptual image comparison, and GMM minimization</details> |

We investigate three cases: the simulation of the entire visible Universe, the simulation of Earth only, or a low resolution simulation of Earth, compatible with high-energy neutrino observations. In all cases, the amounts of energy or power required by any version of the simulation hypothesis are entirely incompatible with physics, or (literally) astronomically large, even in the lowest resolution case. Only universes with very different physical properties can produce some version of this Universe as a simulation. On the other hand, our results show that it is just impossible that this Universe is simulated by a universe sharing the same properties, regardless of technological advancements of the far future.</details> |

However, their direct effect on elastic properties, particularly in systems with attractive interactions, remains poorly understood. Gaining insight into this relationship is important for designing soft particle-based materials with desired mechanical response. In this work, we study how particle size ratio and composition affect the shear modulus of attractive particle systems. Using coarse-grained molecular simulations, we analyze systems composed of two particle sizes at fixed total packing fraction and find that the shear modulus increases systematically with bidispersity. To explain this behavior, we develop two asymptotic models following limiting cases: one where a percolated network of large particles is stiffened by small particles, and another where a small-particle network is modified by embedded large particles. Both models yield closed-form expressions that capture the qualitative trends observed in simulations, including the dependence of shear modulus on size ratio and relative volume fraction. Our results demonstrate that bidispersity can enhance elastic stiffness through microstructural effects, independently of overall density, offering a simple strategy to design particle-based materials with tunable mechanical properties.</details> |

Cox et.al. | [2504.08382](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08382) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present new aposteriori error estimates for the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method applied to non-stationary convection-diffusion equations. The focus is on strongly convection-dominated problems without zeroth-order reaction terms, which leads to the absence of positive L^2-like components. An important specific example is the energy/temperature equation of the Boussinesq system arising from the modelling of mantle convection of the Earth. The key mathematical challenge of mitigating the effects of exponential factors with respect to the final time, arising from the use of Gronwall-type arguments, is addressed by an exponential fitting technique. The latter results to a new class of aposteriori error estimates for the stationary problem, which are valid in cases of convection and reaction coefficient combinations not covered by the existing literature. This new class of estimators is combined with an elliptic reconstruction technique to derive new respective estimates for the non-stationary problem, exhibiting reduced dependence on Gronwall-type exponents and, thus, offer more accurate estimation for longer time intervals. We showcase the superior performance of the new class of aposteriori error estimators in driving mesh adaptivity in Earth's mantle convection simulations, in a setting where the energy/temperature equation is discretised by the discontinuous Galerkin method, coupled with the Taylor-Hood finite element for the momentum and mass conservation equations. We exploit the community code ASPECT, to present numerical examples showing the effectivity of the proposed approach.</details> |

However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.</details> |

By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.</details> |

Traditional methods require deriving a multi-phase ansatz to close the moment system of the Liouville equation, a process that is often computationally intensive and impractical. Our method offers an efficient alternative by introducing a novel two-stage neural network framework to close the $2N\times 2N$ moment system, where $N$ represents the number of phases in the solution ansatz. In the first stage, we train neural networks to learn the mapping between higher-order moments and lower-order moments (along with their derivatives). The second stage incorporates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where we substitute the learned higher-order moments to systematically close the system. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of both the loss functions and the neural network approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for one- and two-dimensional problems with various phase numbers $N$ in the multi-phase solutions. The results confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed approach compared to conventional techniques.</details> |

The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</details> |

We establish that SMADMM achieves an optimal oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}})$ in the online setting, where only stochastic first-order oracle, is available. In particular, SMADMM requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ stochastic gradient evaluations per iteration and avoids the need for restarting with large batch gradient estimates. This is the first stochastic ADMM method achieving optimal oracle complexity for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, requiring $\mathcal{O}(1)$ batch size. Furthermore, we extend our method by integrating it with plug-and-play (PnP) priors, resulting in the PnP-SMADMM algorithm. Numerical experiments on classification, CT image reconstruction and phase retrieve demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach and validate the theoretical findings.</details> |

Kent, Linipun Phuttitarn, Chaithanya Naik Mude et.al. | [2504.08170](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08170) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Quantum computers require high-fidelity measurement of many qubits to achieve a quantum advantage. Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.</details> |

In this work, we systematically benchmark the performance of nearly 200 different XC functionals available within LibXC in this DFA 1-RDMFT framework, contrasting it with their performance in unrestricted KS-DFT. We identify optimal XC functionals for use within DFA 1-RDMFT and elucidate fundamental trends in the response of different XC functionals to strong correlation in both DFA 1-RDMFT and UKS-DFT.</details> |

Here, we propose that cellular development follows paths of least action, aligning with foundational physical laws that govern dynamic systems across nature. We introduce a computational framework that takes advantage of the deep connection between the principle of least action and maximum entropy to model developmental processes using Transformers architecture. This approach enables precise quantification of entropy production, information flow curvature, and local irreversibility for developmental asymmetry in single-cell RNA sequence data. Within this unified framework, we provide interpretable metrics: entropy to capture exploration-exploitation trade-offs, curvature to assess plasticity-elasticity dynamics, and entropy production to characterize dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. We validate our method across both single-cell and embryonic development datasets, demonstrating its ability to reveal hidden thermodynamic and informational constraints shaping cellular fate decisions.</details> |

Notably, under such anisotropic conditions, the nonequilibrium dynamics can lead to the occupation of molecular excited states. We consider cases of quenching from attractive to repulsive interaction and vice versa, analyzing the impact of the pre- and postquench states. The analysis of overlap integrals for the both states reveals a significant contribution from the molecular excited state. Moreover, the overlap with the prequench states might serve as an indicator of when this excited state may emerge. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum for the lowest levels in the both isotropic and anisotropic harmonic traps. Throughout our study, we use a Gaussian-shaped finite-range interaction potential.</details> |

Towards the transition to a circular economy in the construction industry, one of the challenges is the lack of a standardised assessment framework and methods to measure circularity at the product level. To support a more sustainable and circular construction industry through robust and enhanced scenario analysis, this paper integrates probabilistic analysis into the coupled assessment framework; this research addresses uncertainties associated with multiple criteria and diverse stakeholders in the construction industry to enable more robust decision-making support on both circularity and sustainability performance. By demonstrating the application in three real-world MMC products, the proposed framework offers a novel approach to simultaneously assess the circularity and sustainability of MMC products with robustness and objectiveness.</details> |

Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.   In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact.

Baker et.al. | [2504.07809](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07809) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We address an algorithm for the least squares fitting of a subset of the eigenvalues of an unknown Hermitian matrix lying an an affine subspace, called the Lift and Projection (LP) method, due to Chen and Chu (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 33 (1996), pp.2417-2430). The LP method iteratively `lifts' the current iterate onto the spectral constraint manifold then 'projects' onto the solution's affine subspace. We prove that this is equivalent to a Riemannian Gradient Descent with respect to a natural Riemannian metric. This insight allows us to derive a more efficient implementation, analyse more precisely its global convergence properties, and naturally append additional constraints to the problem. We provide several numerical experiments to demonstrate the improvement in computation time, which can be more than an order of magnitude if the eigenvalue constraints are on the smallest eigenvalues, the largest eigenvalues, or the eigenvalues closest to a given number. These experiments include an inverse eigenvalue problem arising in Inelastic Neutron Scattering of Manganese-6, which requires the least squares fitting of 16 experimentally observed eigenvalues of a $32400\times32400$ sparse matrix from a 5-dimensional subspace of spin Hamiltonian matrices.</details> |

Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</details> |

The well-posedness of such problems has already been studied extensively provided that the contrast of the coefficient is non-critical. Furthermore, many different approaches have been proposed to construct stable discretizations thereof, because naive finite element discretizations are expected to be non-reliable in general. However, no explicit example proving the actual instability is known and numerical experiments often do not manifest instabilities in a conclusive manner. To this end we construct an explicit example with a broad family of meshes for which we prove that the corresponding naive finite element discretizations are unstable. On the other hand, we also provide a broad family of (non-symmetric) meshes for which we prove that the discretizations are stable. Together, these two findings explain the results observed in numerical experiments.</details> |

In recent years, hardware developments have led to a surge in interest in exploiting mixed precision arithmetic within numerical linear algebra algorithms to take advantage of potential savings in memory requirements, runtime and energy use, whilst still achieving the requested accuracy. We explore employing mixed precision when solving least-squares problems, focusing on the practicalities of developing robust approaches using low precision incomplete Cholesky factorization preconditioners. Key penalties associated with lower precision include a loss of reliability and less accuracy in the computed solution. Through experiments involving problems from practical applications, we study computing incomplete Cholesky factorizations of the normal matrix using low precision and using the factors to precondition LSQR using mixed precision. We investigate level-based and memory-limited incomplete factorization preconditioners. We find that the former are not effective for least-squares problems while the latter can provide high-quality preconditioners. In particular, half precision arithmetic can be considered if high accuracy is not required in the solution or the memory for the incomplete factors is very restricted; otherwise, single precision can be used, and double precision accuracy recovered while reducing memory consumption, even for ill-conditioned problems.</details> |

Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.</details> |

However, such analysis presents additional challenges for the case of homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. In this work the Strang splitting method with variable time steps is investigated for solving the Allen--Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Uniform $H^k$-norm stability is established under the assumption that the initial condition $u^0$ belongs to the Sobolev space $H^k(\Omega)$ with integer $k\ge 0$, using the Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality and the Sobolev embedding inequality. Furthermore, rigorous convergence analysis is provided in the $H^k$-norm for initial conditions $u^0 \in H^{k+6}(\Omega)$ , based on the uniform stability.

We first investigate truncation errors for the L2 and L1-2 methods, which approximate the Caputo derivative via piecewise quadratic interpolation. Then we generalize the results to arbitrary high-order discretization. Theoretical analyses reveal a unified error structure across all schemes: the convergence order equals the difference between the smoothness degree of the function space and the fractional derivative order, i.e., order of error = degree of smoothness - order of the derivative. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings.</details> |

For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$ )-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.</details> |

As such, various technologies have been developed to reduce viscous resistance and enhance energy efficiency in these applications. Air injection and surface treatment are two representative drag reduction techniques. Additionally, efforts to combine multiple drag-reduction techniques have been the subject of extensive research. In this study, the synergistic effects of integrating microbubble injection and superhydrophobic Surface(SHS) drag reduction approaches were analyzed. A 2-way coupling Euler-Lagrange approach was used alongside direct numerical simulation, based on the spectral element method, to investigate the synergistic effects of applying two separate drag reduction methods. Three types of SHS were investigated in our simulations; post type, transverse ridge type, and ridge type. The drag reduction performances and flow characteristics of the various configurations, with and without microbubble injection, were compared in a turbulent horizontal channel flow with $Re_{\tau}=180$ . The results of these tests showed that, combining post-type SHS with microbubbles was the most effective, producing a synergistic drag reduction effect. However, combining microbubble injection with ridge-type SHS increased drag relative to ridge-type SHS alone, showing the importance of carefully selecting wall type for the best possible performance.</details> |

The proposed discretization scheme is based on a space-time variational formulation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the space-time method is conforming and is of Galerkin-type, i.e., trial and test spaces are equal. We consider a tensor-product approach with respect to time and space, using piecewise polynomial, continuous trial and test functions. In this case, we state the global linear system and efficient direct space-time solvers based on exploiting the Kronecker structure of the global system matrix. This leads to the Bartels-Stewart method and the fast diagonalization method. Both methods result in solving a sequence of spatial subproblems. In particular, the fast diagonalization method allows for solving the spatial subproblems in parallel, i.e., a time parallelization is possible. Numerical examples for a two-dimensional spatial domain illustrate convergence in space-time norms and show the potential of the proposed solvers.</details> |

Simulations of the facility have been performed using a three-dimensional, multiphysics computational framework, which reveals pronounced three-dimensional characteristics within the facility. The analysis of the plasma and electromagnetic field in the torch region reveals the influence of the helical coils, which cause a non-axisymmetric distribution of the plasma discharge. Additionally, simulations of the torch-chamber configuration at two operating pressures have been conducted to examine the impact of plasma asymmetry in the torch on jet characteristics in the chamber. The results indicate an unsteady, three-dimensional behavior of the plasma jet at high pressure. Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) has been performed on the unsteady flow field to identify the dominant modes and their associated frequencies. At low pressure, a steady, supersonic, nearly axisymmetric plasma jet forms with consistent flow properties, such as temperature and velocity. However, strong non-equilibrium effects at low pressures lead to substantial deviations in species concentrations from axial symmetry despite having an almost axisymmetric distribution for quantities such as velocity and temperatures.</details> |

Traditional Krylov methods, such as the Lanczos or CG algorithm, are known to be optimal for the computation of $(A+sI)^{-1}B$ with real positive $s$, resulting in an adaptation to the distinctively discrete and nonuniform spectra. However, the adaptation is damped for matrices with dense spectra. It was demonstrated in [Zimmerling, Druskin, Simoncini, Journal of Scientific Computing 103(1), 5 (2025)] that averaging Gau{\ss} and Gau\ss -Radau quadratures computed using the block-Lanczos method significantly reduces approximation errors for such problems. Here, we introduce an adaptive Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman extension to the (block) Lanczos recursions, allowing further acceleration at negligible $o(n)$ cost. Similar to the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, a low-rank modification is applied to the (block) Lanczos matrix. However, unlike the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, this modification depends on $\sqrt{s}$ and can be considered in the framework of the Hermite-Pad\'e approximants, which are known to be efficient for problems with branch-cuts, that can be good approximations to dense spectral intervals. Numerical results for large-scale discretizations of heat-diffusion and quasi-magnetostatic Maxwell's operators in unbounded domains confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.</details> |

Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.</details> |

We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$ -algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</details> |
| 2025-04-09 | On the Compressibility of Integral Operators in Anisotropic Wavelet Coordinates | Helmut Harbrecht, Remo von Rickenbach et.al. | [2504.06938](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06938) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The present article is concerned with the s*-compressibility of classical boundary integral operators in anisotropic wavelet coordinates. Having the s*-compressibility at hand, one can design adaptive wavelet algorithms which are asymptotically optimal, meaning that any target accuracy can be achieved at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of degrees of freedom (within the setting determined by an underlying wavelet basis) that would ideally be necessary for realising that target accuracy if full knowledge about the unknown solution were given. As we consider here anisotropic wavelet coordinates, we can achieve higher convergence rates compared to the standard, isotropic setting. Especially, edge singularities of anisotropic nature can be resolved.</details> |
| 2025-04-09 | A modified-residue prescription to calculate dynamical correlation functions | Igor Benek-Lins, Jonathan Discenza, Saurabh Maiti et.al. | [2504.06912](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06912) |  | 12 pages, 8 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>One of the challenges in using numerical methods to address many-body problems is the multi-dimensional integration over poles. More often that not, one needs such integrations to be evaluated as a function of an external variable. An example would be calculating dynamical correlations functions that are used to model response functions, where the external variable is the frequency. The standard numerical techniques rely on building an adaptive mesh, using special points in the Brillouin zone or using advanced smearing techniques. Most of these techniques, however, suffer when the grid is coarse. Here we propose that, if one knows the nature of the singularity in the integrand, one can define a residue and use it to faithfully estimate the integral and reproduce all the resulting singular features even with a coarse grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for different scenarios of calculating correlation functions with different resulting singular features, for calculating collective modes and densities of states. We also present a quantitative analysis of the error and show that this method can be widely applicable.</details> |

The implementation provides a simple API extension for specifying the numerical precision for individual kernels, and thus allows for testing the effect of low and mixed precision on the accuracy of the solution. To showcase this, we study the impact of precision on the overall convergence order and actual accuracy of the method as achieved for four common hyperbolic PDE systems and five relevant scenarios that feature an analytic solution. For all scenarios, we also assess how sensitive each kernel of the ADER-DG algorithm is to using double, single or even half precision. This addresses the question where thoughtful adoption of mixed precision can mitigate hurtful effects of low precision on the overall simulation.</details> |

Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.</details> |

This study aims to develop an analytical method for accurately identifying leak locations in gas pipelines based on unsteady gas flow dynamics. A novel approach is proposed that utilizes pressure variations at the inlet and outlet points to determine the minimum fixation time (t = t1) required for real-time leak detection. Through mathematical modeling and numerical analysis, the study demonstrates that the ratio of pressure drops at different points along the pipeline can be effectively used to pinpoint leakage locations. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves detection accuracy and response time, making it a viable solution for integration into gas pipeline monitoring and control systems.</details> |

This paper introduces a multi-level grading and classification system that combines Bayesian probabilistic modeling with scenario-based performance thresholds to assess the reusability of end-of-life modular components. By grading components across a five-tier scale, the system supports strategic decisions for reuse, up-use, or down-use, ensuring alignment with engineering standards and sustainability objectives. The model's development is grounded in empirical data from precast concrete wall panels, and its explainability is enhanced through decision tree logic and Sankey visualizations that trace the influence of contextual scenarios on classification outcomes. MGCS addresses the environmental, economic, and operational challenges of EoL management--reducing material waste, optimizing value recovery, and improving workflow efficiency. Through dynamic feature weighting and transparent reasoning, the system offers a practical yet rigorous pathway to embed circular thinking into construction industry practices.</details> |

This study presents an innovative integration of High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures to address the complexities of reduced-order modeling (ROM) in fluid dynamics. HOSVD improves the dimensionality reduction process by preserving multidimensional structures, surpassing the limitations of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The methodology is tested across numerical and experimental data sets, including two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) cylinder wake flows, spanning both laminar and turbulent regimes. The emphasis is also on exploring how the depth and complexity of LSTM architectures contribute to improving predictive performance. Simpler architectures with a single dense layer effectively capture the periodic dynamics, demonstrating the network's ability to model non-linearities and chaotic dynamics. The addition of extra layers provides higher accuracy at minimal computational cost. These additional layers enable the network to expand its representational capacity, improving the prediction accuracy and reliability. The results demonstrate that HOSVD outperforms SVD in all tested scenarios, as evidenced by using different error metrics. Efficient mode truncation by HOSVD-based models enables the capture of complex temporal patterns, offering reliable predictions even in challenging, noise-influenced data sets. The findings underscore the adaptability and robustness of HOSVD-LSTM architectures, offering a scalable framework for modeling fluid dynamics.</details> |

The system is discretized by continuous Galerkin methods in time and equal-order finite element methods in space. An optimal order error estimate is proved for the norm of the first-order energy of the unknowns of the system. The estimate is confirmed by numerical experiments.</details> |

Many applications, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification, are based on shape derivatives. However, computing high order shape derivatives is challenging due to the complexity of shape calculus. This work introduces a comprehensive method for computing shape Taylor expansions in two dimensions using recurrence formulas. The approach is developed under sound-soft, sound-hard, impedance, and transmission boundary conditions. Additionally, we apply the shape Taylor expansion to uncertainty quantification in wave scattering, enabling high order moment estimation for the scattered field under random boundary perturbations. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the shape Taylor expansion in achieving high order approximations.</details> |

In such scenarios, one seeks to maximize the marginal likelihood associated to a Bayesian model. This latter model is connected to the solution of partial or ordinary differential equation. As such, there are two primary difficulties in maximizing the marginal likelihood (i) that the solution of differential equation is not always analytically tractable and (ii) neither is the marginal likelihood. Typically (i) is dealt with using a numerical solution of the differential equation, leading to a numerical bias and (ii) has been well studied in the literature using, for instance, Markovian stochastic approximation. It is well-known that to reduce the computational effort to obtain the maximal value of the parameter, one can use a hierarchy of solutions of the differential equation and combine with stochastic gradient methods. Several approaches do exactly this. In this paper we consider the asymptotic variance in the central limit theorem, associated to known estimates and find bounds on the asymptotic variance in terms of the precision of the solution of the differential equation. The significance of these bounds are the that they provide missing theoretical guidelines on how to set simulation parameters; that is, these appear to be the first mathematical results which help to run the methods efficiently in practice.</details> |

The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</details> |

Peter et.al. | [2504.06425](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06425) |  | 24 pages, 14 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a neural network approach for fast evaluation of parameter-dependent polyconvex envelopes, which are crucial in computational mechanics. Our method uses a neural network architecture that inherently encodes polyconvexity in the main variable by combining a feature extraction layer that computes the minors function on the signed singular value characterisation of isotropic energy densities with a partially input convex neural network (PICNN). Polyconvex underestimation is weakly enforced by penalisation during training, as are the symmetries of the function. As a guiding example, we focus on a well-known isotropic damage problem, reformulated in terms of signed singular values, and apply a splitting approach to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, thereby making training more tractable. Numerical experiments show that the networks achieve sufficient accuracy for engineering applications while providing high compression and significant speed-up over traditional polyconvexification schemes. Most importantly, the network adapts to varying physical or material parameters, enabling real-time polyconvexification in large-scale computational mechanics scenarios.</details> |

Arbó, María Silvia Gravielle et.al. | [2504.06388](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06388) |  | 23 pages, 11 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a method for accurately computing transition probabilities in one-dimensional photoionization problems. Our approach involves solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and projecting its solution onto scattering states that satisfy the correct incoming or outgoing boundary conditions. Conventionally, the photoelectron emission spectrum is obtained by projecting the time-evolved wavefunction onto the stationary continuum eigenstates of the unperturbed, time-independent Hamiltonian. However, when the spatial potential is symmetric, both the initial bound state and the final continuum states exhibit well-defined parity. The propagated wavefunction retains structural features of the initial bound state, including its parity. As a result, changes in the parity of the continuum states can introduce substantial variations in the projections, leading to spurious oscillations in the computed electron emission spectrum. Our method circumvents this issue by employing scattering states without defined parity. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of directional emission, making it possible to study emission asymmetries. To illustrate the capabilities of our scattering projection method, we analyze the partial differential photoionization probabilities of Al(111) metallic surfaces under short laser pulses at grazing incidence.</details> |

Then we derive a mathematical analysis of our general algorithmic approaches that establishes theoretical results on approximation errors, convergence behaviors, and other algorithmic properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our general algorithmic approaches provide significant improvements in computation times over the most efficient existing numerical methods.</details> |

While current theory suggests that the number of denoising steps required for accurate sample generation should scale linearly with data dimension, this does not reflect the practical efficiency of widely used algorithms like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions that can be well-approximated by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). For these distributions, our main result shows that DDPM takes at most $\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ iterations to attain an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution in total variation (TV) distance, independent of both the ambient dimension $d$ and the number of components $K$ , up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, this result remains robust to score estimation errors. These findings highlight the remarkable effectiveness of diffusion models in high-dimensional settings given the universal approximation capability of GMMs, and provide theoretical insights into their practical success.</details> |

After characterizing the norms of the operators involved, we introduce the concept of admissible integral k-mesh, which allows for the construction of robust approximation schemes, and is used to extract interpolation sets with high stability properties. To this end, the concepts of Fekete currents and Leja sequences of currents are formalized, and a numerical scheme for their approximation is proposed.</details> |

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.</details> |

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical methods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show that polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly extracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach, we predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external electric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the phase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO $_3$ perovskite. This work thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical response--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables accurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at scale.</details> |

To achieve this, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm with two key features: it is applicable to non-orientable surfaces, thereby generalizing previous approaches, and it has a worst-case time complexity that is linear in the number of edges of the mesh $\mathcal{K}$ triangulating $\Gamma$ . Importantly, this algorithm serves as a critical pre-processing step to address the low-frequency breakdown encountered in boundary element discretizations of integral equation formulations.</details> |

Due to the heterogeneity and nonlocality, the linear Fourier analysis gives rise to \textit{strongly coupled} infinite differential systems. By introducing suitable changes of basis as well as the Gershgorin disks theorem for infinite matrices, we first show that all $N$-th Gershgorin disks lie completely on the left half-plane for sufficiently large $N$. For the remaining finitely many disks, a computer-assisted proof shows that if the intensity $\delta$ of the nonlocal term is large enough, there is precisely one eigenvalue with positive real part, which proves the Turing instability. Moreover, by detailed study of this eigenvalue as a function of $\delta$, we obtain a sharp threshold $\delta^*$ which is the bifurcation point for Turing instability.</details> |

Schütte et.al. | [2504.05026](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05026) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A new method to solve computationally challenging (random) parametric obstacle problems is developed and analyzed, where the parameters can influence the related partial differential equation (PDE) and determine the position and surface structure of the obstacle. As governing equation, a stationary elliptic diffusion problem is assumed. The high-dimensional solution of the obstacle problem is approximated by a specifically constructed convolutional neural network (CNN). This novel algorithm is inspired by a finite element constrained multigrid algorithm to represent the parameter to solution map. This has two benefits: First, it allows for efficient practical computations since multi-level data is used as an explicit output of the NN thanks to an appropriate data preprocessing. This improves the efficacy of the training process and subsequently leads to small errors in the natural energy norm. Second, the comparison of the CNN to a multigrid algorithm provides means to carry out a complete a priori convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed NN architecture. Numerical experiments illustrate a state-of-the-art performance for this challenging problem.</details> |

The architecture leverages the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials as basis functions, significantly enhancing both convergence speed and solution accuracy compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem provides a strong theoretical foundation for the interpretability and optimization of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples, involving both smooth and singular solutions in various dimensions. This work not only addresses the challenges of solving high-dimensional and singular Monge-Amp\`ere equations but also highlights the potential of neural network-based approaches for complex partial differential equations. Additionally, the method is applied to the optimal transport problem in image mapping, showcasing its practical utility in geometric image transformation. This approach is expected to pave the way for further enhancement of KAN-based applications and numerical solutions of PDEs across a wide range of scientific and engineering fields.</details> |

Using anisotropic interpolation operators the estimator is elementwise separated with respect to the single directions in space and time leading to adaptive, anisotropic mesh refinement in a natural way. To prevent spurious oscillations the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method is applied to stabilize the underlying system in the case of high P\'{e}clet numbers. Efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithm are demonstrated for different goal functionals. The directional error indicators quantify anisotropy of the solution with respect to the goal, and produce meshes that efficiently capture sharp layers. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed approach over isotropic adaptive and global mesh refinement using established benchmarks for convection-dominated transport.</details> |

Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarms optimisation algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyse these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging and non-converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.</details> |

Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</details> |

We discuss the geometric properties of the model at the continuous level, and how to discretize the model in the GEMPIC framework [1]. This method allows us to keep the structure of the system at the semi-discrete level. To integrate the model in time, we employ a Poisson splitting and discuss how to integrate each subsystem separately. We test the model against the full Vlasov-Maxwell model with a control variate method for noise reduction; the two chosen test-cases are the weak Landau damping and the Bernstein waves. Both test-cases exhibit the same physical properties for short simulations but our model enjoys better long-time stability and energy conservation due to its geometric construction. The model is implemented in the open-source Python library STRUPHY [2, 3].</details> |

Most studies have been carried out on maps (discrete-time systems). We analyse a scenario of global changes of the structure of an attractor in continuous-time systems leading to an unbounded growth of the topological entropy of the underlying dynamical system. As an example, we consider the classical Roessler system. We show that for an explicit range of parameters a chaotic attractor exists. We also prove the existence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to the growth of the topological entropy. The proofs are computer-aided.</details> |

The domain is decomposed into nonoverlapping subdomains, and the continuity of the displacement component across the subdomain interface is enforced by introducing a Lagrange multiplier. After eliminating all displacement variables and the independent subdomain interior components of pressure and total pressure, the problem is reduced to a symmetric positive definite linear system for the subdomain interface pressure, total pressure, and the Lagrange multiplier. This reduced system is solved by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method, with a block dual-primal preconditioner using a Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints (BDDC) preconditioner for both the interface total pressure block and the interface pressure blocks, as well as a Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting-Dual Primal (FETI-DP) preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier block. By analyzing the conditioning of the preconditioned subsystem associated with the interface pressure and total pressure components, we obtain a condition number bound of the preconditioned system, which is scalable in the number of subdomains, poly-logarithmic in the ratio of subdomain and mesh sizes, and robust with respect to the parameters of the model. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the theoretical result of the proposed algorithm.</details> |

The multiphase model, consisting of solid and liquid phases, is written as a convection-reaction system with a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation with degenerate mobility coupled to a Stokes-flow equation for the mixture velocity. An upwind discontinuous Galerkin approach is used to approximate the convection-reaction equations, whereas an $H^1$ -conforming primal formulation is proposed for the Stokes system. By means of a splitting procedure due to the reaction terms, an invariant-region principle is shown for the concentration unknowns, namely non-negativity for all phases and an upper bound for the total concentration of the solid phases. Numerical examples with reduced biofilm reactions are presented to illustrate the performance of the model and numerical scheme.</details> |
| 2025-04-03 | Convergence of the Markovian iteration for coupled FBSDEs via a differentiation approach | Zhipeng Huang, Cornelis W. Oosterlee et.al. | [2504.02814](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02814) |  | 28 pages, 2 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we investigate the Markovian iteration method for solving coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) featuring a fully coupled forward drift, meaning the drift term explicitly depends on both the forward and backward processes. An FBSDE system typically involves three stochastic processes: the forward process $X$, the backward process $Y$ representing the solution, and the $Z$ process corresponding to the scaled derivative of $Y$. Prior research by Bender and Zhang (2008) has established convergence results for iterative schemes dealing with $Y$-coupled FBSDEs. However, extending these results to equations with $Z$ coupling poses significant challenges, especially in uniformly controlling the Lipschitz constant of the decoupling fields across iterations and time steps within a fixed-point framework.   To overcome this issue, we propose a novel differentiation-based method for handling the $Z$ process. This approach enables improved management of the Lipschitz continuity of decoupling fields, facilitating the well-posedness of the discretized FBSDE system with fully coupled drift. We rigorously prove the convergence of our Markovian iteration method in this more complex setting. Finally, numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights, showcasing the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.</details> |

Pavliotis, Niccolò Zagli et.al. | [2504.02721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721) |  | 28 pages, 4 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</details> |

By modeling interior point distributions in a convex domain as repelling charges balanced against a continuous boundary charge, we show that the resulting equilibrium configurations converge to CVT structures. We prove this by showing that CVTs minimize both the classical centroidal energy and the electrostatic potential, establishing a connection between geometric quantization and potential theory. Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic annealing scheme for global CVT optimization, rooted in Boltzmann statistics and random walk dynamics. By introducing a scheme for varying time steps (faster or slower cooling) we show that the set of minima of the centroid energy functional (and therefore the electrostatic potential) can be recovered. By recovering a set of generator locations corresponding to each minimum we can create a lattice continuation that allows for a customizable framework for individual minimum seeking.</details> |

For this aim, we rely on projection-based model order reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by projecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller dimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type strategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for source problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation error related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since the difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the so-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate, we propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues and for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR approximation of the spectral gap. Based on that, a second subspace is then generated for the MOR approximation of the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. We also provide efficiently computable conditions to ensure that the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue is fully captured in the reduced space. This work is motivated by a specific application: the repeated identifications of the states with minimal energy, the so-called ground states, of parametric quantum spin system models.</details> |
| 2025-04-03 | An efficient and energy-stable IMEX splitting scheme for dispersed multiphase flows | Douglas Pacheco, Richard Schussnig et.al. | [2504.02629](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02629) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations are used in various applications to model systems with two or more interpenetrating phases. Each fluid obeys its own momentum and mass equations, and the phases are typically coupled via drag forces and a shared pressure. Monolithic solvers can therefore be very expensive and difficult to implement. On the other hand, designing robust splitting schemes requires making both pressure and drag forces explicit without sacrificing temporal stability. In this context, we derive a new first-order pressure-correction method based on the incompressibility of the mean velocity field, combined with an explicit treatment of the drag forces. Furthermore, the convective terms are linearised using extrapolated velocities, while the viscous terms are treated semi-implicitly. This gives us an implicit-explicit (IMEX) method that is very robust not only due to its unconditional energy stability, but also because it does not require any type of fixed-point iterations. Each time step involves only linear, scalar transport equations and a single Poisson problem as building blocks, thereby offering both efficiency and simplicity. We rigorously prove temporal stability without any time-step size restrictions, and the theory is confirmed through two-phase numerical examples.</details> |

For that purpose we apply anisotropic tensor products of the univariate B-spline quarklets introduced around 2017 by Dahlke, Keding and Raasch. We introduce the concept of bivariate quarklet trees and develop an adaptive algorithm which allows for generalized hp-approximation of a given bivariate function by selected frame elements. It is proved that this algorithm is near-best, which means that as long as some standard conditions concerning local errors are fulfilled it provides an approximation with an error close to that one of the best possible quarklet tree approximation. For this algorithm the complexity is investigated. Moreover, we use our techniques to approximate a bivariate test function with inverse-exponential rates of convergence. It can be expected that the results presented in this paper serve as important building block for the design of adaptive wavelet-hp-methods for solving PDEs in the bivariate setting with very good convergence properties.</details> |

This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to behaviours around testing and isolation. This epidemiological-behavioural interaction is of particular interest as, prospectively, it is well-placed to be informed by real-world data temporally monitoring test results and compliance with testing policy. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing "behaviour and disease" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented interdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions (including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural effects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage further modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease dynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.</details> |

These models require minimal computational effort and an extremely robust solver for large-scale, long-term simulations. The weak enthalpy formulation of the Stefan problem is used as the mathematical model and a finite element method is employed for the discretization. Leveraging the piecewise affine structure of the nonlinear time-stepping equation system, we demonstrate that this system has a unique solution and provide a solver that is guaranteed to find this solution in a finite number of steps from any initial guess. Comparisons with the Neumann analytical solution and tests in the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land vegetation model reveal that the new method does not introduce significantly higher computational costs than the widely used DECP method while providing greater accuracy. In particular, it avoids a known nonphysical artifact in the solution.</details> |

We propose a scalable, non-iterative algorithm that efficiently recovers the underlying low-rank structure in the presence of row-wise adversarial corruption. By first compressing the data with a Johnson Lindenstrauss projection, our approach preserves the geometry of clean rows while dramatically reducing dimensionality. Robust statistical techniques based on the median and median absolute deviation then enable precise identification and removal of outlier rows with abnormally high norms. The subsequent rank-k approximation achieves near-optimal error bounds with a one pass procedure that scales linearly with the number of observations. Empirical results confirm that combining random sketches with robust statistics yields efficient, accurate decompositions even in the presence of large fractions of corrupted rows.</details> |

First, the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$-points in the Brillouin zone can reduce the number of Kohn-Sham equations to be solved. This necessitates the correct implementation of the rotation relation between the density matrices of equivalent $\mathbf{k}$-points within the representation of atomic orbitals. Second, the reduction of the real-space sector can accelerate the construction of the exact-exchange part of the Hamiltonian in real space. We have implemented this algorithm in the ABACUS software interfaced with LibRI, and tested its performance for several types of crystal systems with different symmetries. The expected speed-up is achieved in both aspects: the time of solving the Kohn-Sham equations decreases in proportion with the reduction of $\mathbf{k}$ -points, while the construction of the Hamiltonian in real space is sped up by several times, with the degree of acceleration depending on the size and symmetry of the system.</details> |

In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</details> |

In this work, we explore the applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734) using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials.</details> |

Our approach leverages the quantum-classical correspondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave sum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply this framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of non-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict wavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations. These findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight the potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon triplet sources with quantum state control.</details> |

A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</details> |

The transformed equation is then discretized by using the finite element method with continuous piecewise multilinear basis functions in space and the BDF2 scheme in time to produce a fully discrete numerical scheme. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we prove the convergence of the DDM solution to the original solution as the interface thickness parameter goes to zero, with the corresponding approximation errors under the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms. Furthermore, the optimal error estimate for the fully discrete DDFE scheme is also obtained under the $H^1$ norm. Various numerical experiments are finally carried out to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</details> |

For an illustrative example of a single-stage stochastic optimal control problem, analytical expressions for approximation error and scaling laws, with respect to the state dimension and sample size, are derived. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.</details> |

In the modified Langevin noise formalism, the boundary- and medium-assisted (BA and MA) fields, which constitute a continuum set of EM modes in dissipative EM environments, are numerically obtained using the finite-element method (FEM). Specifically, BA field modes are extracted by solving plane-wave scattering problems, while MA field modes are determined through point-source radiation problems. These numerically obtained BA and MA field modes are then incorporated into the multimode Jaynes- and Tavis-Cummings models such that the coupling strength between atoms and BA-MA field modes can be calculated for the study of atom-field interactions in dissipative EM environments. The proposed methodology captures non-Markovian atomic dynamics that cannot be described by traditional quantum master equations under the Markovian approximation. To validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical framework, we present four numerical examples: (i) a two-level system (TLS) in a perfect electric conductor (PEC) half-space; (ii) dissipative cavity electrodynamics with two limiting cases approaching spontaneous emission in free space and ideal Rabi oscillations; (iii) super-radiance in TLS arrays; and (iv) entanglement sudden death of two TLSs inside dissipative cavities. The proposed methodology can serve as a ground-truth numerical simulator for studying atom-field interactions in general dissipative EM environments.</details> |

Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorised solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</details> |

Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarm optimization algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to a motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyze these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different from non-converging ones in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.   An identification of a key factor responsible for the intensity of their phase transition is the main contribution of this paper. We examined an optimization as a process with three variable factors -- an algorithm, number generator and optimization function. More than 9.000 executions of the optimization algorithm revealed that the nature of an applied algorithm itself is the main source of the phase transitions. Some of the algorithms exhibit larger transition-shifting behavior while others perform rather transition-steady computing. These findings might be important for future extensions of these algorithms.</details> |

Bryngelson et.al. | [2503.24286](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24286) | **[link](https://github.com/pyrometheus/pyrometheus)** | 41 pages, 12 figures, 29 listings, 60 references | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The cost of combustion simulations is often dominated by the evaluation of net production rates of chemical species and mixture thermodynamics (thermochemistry). Execution on computing accelerators (XPUs) like graphic processing units (GPUs) can greatly reduce this cost. However, established thermochemistry software is not readily portable to such devices or sacrifices valuable analytical forms that enable differentiation for sensitivity analysis and implicit time integration. Symbolic abstractions are developed with corresponding transformations that enable computation on accelerators and automatic differentiation by avoiding premature specification of detail. The software package Pyrometheus is introduced as an implementation of these abstractions and their transformations for combustion thermochemistry. The formulation facilitates code generation from the symbolic representation of a specific thermochemical mechanism in multiple target languages, including Python, C++, and Fortran. Computational concerns are separated: the generated code processes array-valued expressions but does not specify their semantics. These semantics are provided by compatible array libraries, such as NumPy, Pytato, and Google JAX. Thus, the generated code retains a symbolic representation of the thermochemistry, which translates to computation on accelerators and CPUs and automatic differentiation. The design and operation of these symbolic abstractions and their companion tool, Pyrometheus, are discussed throughout. Roofline demonstrations show that the computation of chemical source terms within MFC, a Fortran-based flow solver we link to Pyrometheus, is performant.</details> |

The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian white noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are called White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely applied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions as Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.   In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate representation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not only account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also effectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we apply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and demonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its nonlinear characteristic.</details> |

It is well known that no explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\lambda$ . Furthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific integrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally stable'. Such optimal stability results are typically proven using sophisticated techniques from complex analysis, leading to rather abstruse proofs. In this article, we pursue an alternative approach, exploiting connections with the Bernstein and Markov brothers inequalities for polynomials. This simplifies the proofs greatly and offers a framework which unifies the diverse results that have been obtained.</details> |

Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</details> |

The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement. Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics. Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and efficiency.</details> |
| 2025-03-31 | A simple and general framework for the construction of exactly div-curl-grad compatible discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured simplex meshes | R. Abgrall, M. Dumbser, P. H. Maire et.al. | [2503.24131](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24131) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We introduce a new family of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the discretization of first order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) on unstructured simplex meshes in two and three space dimensions that respect the two basic vector calculus identities exactly also at the discrete level, namely that the curl of the gradient is zero and that the divergence of the curl is zero. The key ingredient here is the construction of two compatible discrete nabla operators, a primary one and a dual one, both defined on general unstructured simplex meshes in multiple space dimensions. Our new schemes extend existing cell-centered finite volume methods based on corner fluxes to arbitrary high order of accuracy in space. An important feature of our new method is the fact that only two different discrete function spaces are needed to represent the numerical solution, and the choice of the appropriate function space for each variable is related to the origin and nature of the underlying PDE. The first class of variables is discretized at the aid of a discontinuous Galerkin approach, where the numerical solution is represented via piecewise polynomials of degree N and which are allowed to jump across element interfaces. This set of variables is related to those PDE which are mere consequences of the definitions, derived from some abstract scalar and vector potentials, and for which involutions like the divergence-free or the curl-free property must hold if satisfied by the initial data. The second class of variables is discretized via classical continuous Lagrange finite elements of approximation degree M=N+1 and is related to those PDE which can be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations of an underlying variational principle.</details> |

This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving solid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter into the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of fluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously reconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution, thereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse scenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows, such as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and subsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of hidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of trajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the effects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference accuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting its potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data are available.</details> |

Traditional computational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and efficiency. We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this dilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water systems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic properties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE) calculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations, our approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band gaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This work bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering transformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate science, and energy storage.</details> |

We also show discrete long-time estimates, which prove that certain norms are preserved for all times, uniformly in the mesh size and time step. In particular, we prove higher regularity estimates which provide an analogue of continuum parabolic higher regularity estimates. Finally, we numerically study the rate of convergence of the scheme, and we provide examples of the existence of multiple metastable steady states.</details> |

Szajek et.al. | [2503.23969](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23969) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe $_2$ have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP) correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between 0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$ , the feature is inferred also from the VB studies.</details> |

The idea is that these rates could be used to validate implementations of boundary integral operators and allow to test operators separately by choosing solutions where parts of the Calder\'on identities vanish. Our estimates rely on simple vector norms, and thus avoid the use of hard-to-compute norms and the residual computation can be easily implemented in existing boundary element codes. We test the proposed Calder\'on residuals as debugging tool by introducing artificial errors into the Galerkin matrices of some of the boundary integral operators for the Laplacian and time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. From this, we learn that our estimates are not sharp enough to always detect errors, but still provide a simple and useful debugging tool in many situations.</details> |

Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</details> |

Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.</details> |

In this work, we focus on distributional regression and introduce a framework that enables the model to abstain from estimation in situations of high uncertainty. We refer to this approach as distributional regression with reject option, inspired by similar concepts in classification and regression with reject option. We study the scenario where the rejection rate is fixed. We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal rule, which relies on thresholding the entropy function of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). We propose a semi-supervised estimation procedure for the optimal rule, using two datasets: the first, labeled, is used to estimate both the conditional distribution function and the entropy function of the CRPS, while the second, unlabeled, is employed to calibrate the desired rejection rate. Notably, the control of the rejection rate is distribution-free. Under mild conditions, we show that our procedure is asymptotically as effective as the optimal rule, both in terms of error rate and rejection rate. Additionally, we establish rates of convergence for our approach based on distributional k-nearest neighbor. A numerical analysis on real-world datasets demonstrates the strong performance of our procedure</details> |

However, achieving accurate long-time integration for these equations remains a significant challenge. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free framework for solving PDEs, they often suffer from temporal error accumulation, which limits their effectiveness in capturing long-time behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we propose integral regularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal accuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss function. This method divides the entire time interval into smaller sub-intervals and enforces constraints over these sub-intervals, thereby improving the resolution and correlation of temporal dynamics. Furthermore, IR-PINNs leverage adaptive sampling to dynamically refine the distribution of collocation points based on the evolving solution, ensuring higher accuracy in regions with sharp gradients or rapid variations. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that IR-PINNs outperform original PINNs and other state-of-the-art methods in capturing long-time behaviors, offering a robust and accurate solution for evolution equations.</details> |

Owing to its modular architecture and high-throughput capabilities, the framework effectively mitigates the computational complexity and resource-intensive limitations associated with conventional PIMD approaches. By integrating machine learning force fields (MLFFs) into the framework, we rigorously tested its performance through two representative cases: a small-molecule reaction system (double proton transfer in formic acid dimer) and a bulk-phase transition system (water-ice phase transformation). Computational results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accelerated PIMD simulations while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy. These findings show that nuclear quantum effects can be captured for complex molecular systems, using relatively low computational cost.</details> |

However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on ion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted ion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by applying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge particle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a confined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been considered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the point charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to its motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping frequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state wavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in interactions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose experimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge distribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion due to the energy transfer in atomic collisions.

This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10 $^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$ , even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</details> |

Schmidt et.al. | [2503.22649](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22649) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A stochastic data-driven reduced-order model applicable to a wide range of turbulent natural and engineering flows is presented. Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data.</details> |

Where existing approaches search for simulations violating a formal specification or maximizing a notion of coverage, in this work we propose a new goal for testing: to discover unknown rare behaviors by examining discrete mode sequences. We assume a CPS simulator outputs mode information, and strive to explore the sequences of modes produced by varying the initial state or time-varying uncertainties. We hypothesize that rare mode sequences are often the most interesting to a designer, and we develop two accelerated sampling algorithms that speed up the process of finding such sequences. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, ranging from synthetic examples to Simulink diagrams of a CPS, demonstrating in some cases a speedup of over 100x compared with a random sampling strategy.</details> |

Acebrón et.al. | [2503.22631](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22631) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Many scientific applications require the evaluation of the action of the matrix function over a vector and the most common methods for this task are those based on the Krylov subspace. Since the orthogonalization cost and memory requirement can quickly become overwhelming as the basis grows, the Krylov method is often restarted after a few iterations. This paper proposes a new acceleration technique for restarted Krylov methods based on randomization. The numerical experiments show that the randomized method greatly outperforms the classical approach with the same level of accuracy. In fact, randomization can actually improve the convergence rate of restarted methods in some cases. The paper also compares the performance and stability of the randomized methods proposed so far for solving very large finite element problems, complementing the numerical analyses from previous studies.</details> |

For the Schr\"odinger equation we analyze the exponential-type scheme proposed by Ostermann and Schratz in 2018, whereas in the wave case we treat the corrected Lie splitting proposed by Li, Schratz, and Zivcovich in 2023. We show that the integrators converge with their full order of one and two, respectively. In this situation only fractional convergence rates were previously known. The crucial ingredients in the proofs are known space-time bounds for the solutions to the corresponding linear problems. More precisely, in the Schr\"odinger case we use the $L^4$ Strichartz inequality, and for the wave equation a null form estimate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a null form estimate is exploited in numerical analysis. We apply the estimates for continuous time, thus avoiding potential losses resulting from discrete-time estimates.</details> |

Suksmono et.al. | [2503.22604](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22604) |  | arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.21336 | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</details> |

The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.</details> |

The architecture comprises two key components: the mixed-function neuron, which integrates multiple parameterized nonlinear functions to improve representational flexibility, and the second-order neuron, which combines a linear transformation of its inputs with a quadratic term to capture cross-combinations of input variables. These features significantly enhance the expressive power of the network, enabling it to achieve comparable or superior results with drastically fewer parameters and a reduction of up to four orders of magnitude compared to conventional approaches. We applied MixFunn in a physics-informed setting to solve differential equations in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving higher accuracy and improved generalization to regions outside the training domain relative to standard machine learning models. Furthermore, the architecture facilitates the extraction of interpretable analytical expressions, offering valuable insights into the underlying solutions.</details> |

In this work, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott insulators described by the extended ( $U$-$V$) Hubbard model. We discuss the applicability of the analytical formula for doublon-holon (DH) pair production, previously derived for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which highlights the relationship between the tunneling threshold, the charge gap, and the correlation length. We test the formulas ability to predict both DH pair production and energy increase rate. Using tensor-network-based approaches, we demonstrate that the formula provides accurate predictions in the absence of excitonic states facilitated by the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ . However, when excitonic states emerge, the formula more accurately describes the rate of energy increase than the DH pair creation rate and in both cases gets improved by incorporating the exciton energy as the effective gap.</details> |

The solver employs a low order Shortley-Weller multigrid method to precondition a high order matrix-free Krylov subspace solver. The matrix-free approach enables full compatibility with high order IIM discretizations of boundary and interface conditions, as well as high order wavelet-adapted multiresolution grids. Through verification and analysis on 2D domains, we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to provide high order accurate results to Laplace and Poisson problems with Dirichlet, Neumann, and/or interface jump boundary conditions, all effectively preconditioned using the multigrid method. We further show that the proposed method is able to efficiently solve high order discretizations of Laplace and Poisson problems on complex 3D domains using thousands of compute cores and on multiresolution grids. To our knowledge, this work presents the largest problem sizes tackled with high order immersed methods applied to elliptic partial differential equations, and the first high order results on 3D multiresolution adaptive grids. Together, this work paves the way for employing high order immersed methods to a variety of 3D partial differential equations with boundary or inter-face conditions, including linear and non-linear elasticity problems, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and fluid-structure interactions.</details> |

Hendy et.al. | [2503.22386](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22386) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The study of parametric differential equations plays a crucial role in weather forecasting and epidemiological modeling. These phenomena are better represented using fractional derivatives due to their inherent memory or hereditary effects. This paper introduces a novel scientific machine learning approach for solving parametric time-fractional differential equations by combining traditional spectral methods with neural networks. Instead of relying on automatic differentiation techniques, commonly used in traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), we propose a more efficient global discretization method based on Legendre polynomials. This approach eliminates the need to simulate the parametric fractional differential equations across multiple parameter values. By applying the Legendre-Galerkin weak formulation to the differential equation, we construct a loss function for training the neural network. The trial solutions are represented as linear combinations of Legendre polynomials, with the coefficients learned by the neural network. The convergence of this method is theoretically established, and the theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments on several well-known differential equations.</details> |

Here, we map the phase diagram of MA $_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$ using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers new insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.</details> |

Convergent approximations are obtained using an efficient vectorized solution setup with few convergence requirements for a wide range of nonlinear fractional differential equations. We demonstrate efficiency of the developed method by applying it to the fractional Van der Pol oscillator, a system with applications in control systems and electronic circuits.</details> |

Chaumont-Frelet et.al. | [2503.22297](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22297) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We consider second-order PDE problems set in unbounded domains and discretized by Lagrange finite elements on a finite mesh, thus introducing an artificial boundary in the discretization. Specifically, we consider the reaction diffusion equation as well as Helmholtz problems in waveguides with perfectly matched layers. The usual procedure to deal with such problems is to first consider a modeling error due to the introduction of the artificial boundary, and estimate the remaining discretization error with a standard a posteriori technique. A shortcoming of this method, however, is that it is typically hard to obtain sharp bounds on the modeling error. In this work, we propose a new technique that allows to control the whole error by an a posteriori error estimator. Specifically, we propose a flux-equilibrated estimator that is slightly modified to handle the truncation boundary. For the reaction diffusion equation, we obtain fully-computable guaranteed error bounds, and the estimator is locally efficient and polynomial-degree-robust provided that the elements touching the truncation boundary are not too refined. This last condition may be seen as an extension of the notion of shape-regularity of the mesh, and does not prevent the design of efficient adaptive algorithms. For the Helmholtz problem, as usual, these statements remain valid if the mesh is sufficiently refined. Our theoretical findings are completed with numerical examples which indicate that the estimator is suited to drive optimal adaptive mesh refinements.</details> |

We focus on preconditioners that are the sum of a positive definite and low-rank matrix, which were developed in a previous work. These were constructed as minimisers of the aforementioned divergence, and we show that they are only a constant scaling from also minimising Kaporin's condition number. We highlight connections to information geometry and comment on future directions.</details> |

Here, the solution goes through the use of numerical systems, such as the minimization theories or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. In this paper we fill this gap with a global analytical iterative formulation that is capable to reach the solutions obtained with the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and the minimization methodologies, but that analytically lies to the solutions of Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, or Cramer when the system is simplified.</details> |

A validated numerical model is used to study the impact of particle seeding fluctuations on flame stability. Simulations are conducted for the Bunsen setup in the right-side up and up-side down configuration. No significant differences in flame response are identified in flame stability between the right-side up and up-side down configurations. We find that the Bunsen flame is surprisingly robust to abrupt changes in particle loading. The sudden change in particle loading does not excite any intrinsic instabilities in the flame. Based on our results, the iron dust flames are robust to imposed fluctuations. We hypothesize that this is due to the lack of a feedback mechanism between the burned temperature and the heat release rate. This mechanism is present in conventional, chemistry-driven, gaseous flames. However, such a mechanism is absent in iron dust flames because the combustion of individual iron particles is limited by oxygen diffusion, which is insensitive to temperature.</details> |

The complex geometric domain is divided by a uniform Cartesian grid, resulting in challenge in boundary treatment. The proposed ILW boundary treatment could provide high order approximations of both solution values and spatial derivatives at ghost points outside the computational domain. Distinct from existing ILW approaches, our boundary treatment constructs the extrapolation via optimized through a least squares formulation, coupled with the spatial derivatives at the boundary obtained via the ILW procedure. Theoretical analysis indicates that compared with other ILW methods, our proposed one would require fewer terms by using the relatively complicated ILW procedure and thus improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy and stability. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated through numerical experiments.</details> |

The linear systems arising from the filter embedded in the subspace iteration framework, are solved via a preconditioned Krylov method.   The choice of the poles of the filter is based on two criteria. On the one hand, the filter should enhance the eigenvalues in the interval of interest, which suggests that the poles should be chosen close to or in the interval. On the other hand, the choice of poles has an important impact on the convergence speed of the iterative method. For the solution of problems arising from vibrations, the two criteria contradict each other, since fast convergence of the eigensolver requires poles to be in or close to the interval, whereas the iterative linear system solver becomes cheaper when the poles lie further away from the eigenvalues. In the paper, we propose a selection of poles inspired by the shifted Laplace preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation.   We show numerical experiments from finite element models of vibrations. We compare the shifted Laplace rational filter with rational filters based on quadrature rules for contour integration.</details> |

Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off between minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material amount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex problem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour, creating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality. However, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address manufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts) generated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.   A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue. Additionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be strategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated compliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom (volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies for the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of evolving topological families with distinct features.   The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the volume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double Distance Neural Network (D $^2$ NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps worth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs. This proposal offers a novel topology optimization design space based on minimum strut thickness - via filtering - and topological families defined by minimum volume fraction and compliance. The methodology is tested on several examples with diverse loading and boundary conditions, obtaining similarly satisfactory results, and then boosted via Machine Learning, acting as a fast and cheap surrogate.</details> |

These equations are a generalisation of the classic Volterra integral equations, which were first introduced by Vito Volterra in the late 19th century. The loaded Volterra integral equations are characterised by the presence of a load which complicates the process of their theoretical and numerical study. Sometimes these equation are called the equations with ``frozen'' argument. The present work is devoted to the study of Volterra equations with locally loaded integral operators. The existence and uniquness theorems are proved. Among the main contributions is the collocation method for approximate solution of such equations based on the piecewise linear approximation. To confirm the convergence of the method, a number of numerical results for solving model problems are provided.</details> |

However, precise control over Si diffusion remains a critical challenge for high-performance device applications. This study investigates Si diffusion mechanisms in bulk GaN using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by ultra-high-pressure annealing (UHPA) experiments. Vacancy-mediated diffusion pathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs) and activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic direction, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest barrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly improbable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and ring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ( $>$ 12 eV). Phonon calculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion barriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on Si-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450{\deg}C, 1 GPa) confirms negligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions. These findings resolve inconsistencies in prior reports and establish that Si-doped GaN remains highly stable, ensuring reliable doping profiles for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.</details> |

We give two stochastic algorithms for which we prove the almost sure convergence to the operator norm. The algorithm is a random search method for a generalization of the Rayleigh quotient and uses optimal step sizes. Additionally, a convergence analysis is done for the corresponding singular vector and the respective eigenvalue equation.</details> |

Exponential decay of the Fourier coefficients of the system dynamics is key to guarantee convergence. The paper also analyzes a subharmonic formulation that improves the convergence rate. Two numerical examples, including a Duffing oscillator, illustrate the theoretical findings.</details> |

Instead of using a traditional offline/online splitting approach for model order reduction, we adopt an active learning or enrichment strategy to construct a multi-fidelity hierarchy of reduced order models on-the-fly during the outer optimization loop. The multi-fidelity surrogate model consists of a full order model, a reduced order model and a machine learning model. The proposed hierarchical framework adaptively updates its hierarchy when querying parameters, utilizing a rigorous a posteriori error estimator in an error aware trust region framework. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</details> |

Wang et.al. | [2503.21234](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21234) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper focuses on continuous data assimilation (CDA) for the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions. CDA methods are typically employed to recover the original system when initial data or viscosity coefficients are unknown, by incorporating a feedback control term generated by observational data over a time period. In this study, based on a regularized form derived from the variational inequalities of the Navier-Stokes equations with nonlinear slip boundary conditions, we first investigate the classical CDA problem when initial data is absent. After establishing the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution, we prove its exponential convergence with respect to the time. Additionally, we extend the CDA to address the problem of missing viscosity coefficients and analyze its convergence order, too. Furthermore, utilizing the predictive capabilities of partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs) for time-dependent problems, we propose a novel CDA by replacing observational data with predictions got by pETNNs. Compared with the classical CDA, the new one can achieve similar approximation accuracy but need much less computational cost. Some numerical experiments are presented, which not only validate the theoretical results, but also demonstrate the efficiency of the CDA.</details> |

Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.</details> |

The first uses a combined kernel and neural network representation of UCCSD(T) reference data whereas the second is a corrected PES (cR-PES) that eliminates an artificial barrier in the entrance channel appearing in its initial expansion based on full configuration interaction reference data. Despite the differences between the two PESs, both yield $k_{v=0,j=0} \approx 2 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s at $T = 10$ K which is consistent with a $T-$independent Langevin rate $k_{\rm L} = 2.1 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s but considerably larger than the only experimentally reported value $k_{\rm ICR} = (9.1 \pm 2.5) \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s from ion cyclotron resonance experiments. Similarly, branching ratios for the reaction outcomes are comparable for the two PESs. However, when analysing less averaged properties such as initial state-selected $T-$dependent rate coefficients and final vibrational states of the H$_2^+$ product for low temperatures, the differences in the two PESs manifest themselves in the observables. Thus, depending on the property analyzed, accurate and globally valid representations of the PES are required, whereas more approximate and empirical construction schemes can be followed for state-averaged observables.</details> |

Mathematically, it can be formulated as an optimization problem, which is exactly the optimal transportation problem (OT) when the target is in the far field. The gradient of OT is governed by the generalized Monge-Amp`ere equation that models the far-field reflector system. Based on the gradient, this work presents a Sobolev gradient descent method implemented within a finite element framework to solve the corresponding OT. Convergence of the method is established and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</details> |

Negre et.al. | [2503.21176](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21176) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>With recent advancements in machine learning for interatomic potentials, Python has become the go-to programming language for exploring new ideas. While machine-learning potentials are often developed in Python-based frameworks, existing molecular dynamics software is predominantly written in lower-level languages. This disparity complicates the integration of machine learning potentials into these molecular dynamics libraries. Additionally, machine learning potentials typically focus on local features, often neglecting long-range electrostatics due to computational complexities. This is a key limitation as applications can require long-range electrostatics and even flexible charges to achieve the desired accuracy. Recent charge equilibration models can address these issues, but they require iterative solvers to assign relaxed flexible charges to the atoms. Conventional implementations also demand very tight convergence to achieve long-term stability, further increasing computational cost. In this work, we present a scalable Python implementation of a recently proposed shadow molecular dynamics scheme based on a charge equilibration model, which avoids the convergence problem while maintaining long-term energy stability and accuracy of observable properties. To deliver a functional and user-friendly Python-based library, we implemented an efficient neighbor list algorithm, Particle Mesh Ewald, and traditional Ewald summation techniques, leveraging the GPU-accelerated power of Triton and PyTorch. We integrated these approaches with the Python-based shadow molecular dynamics scheme, enabling fast charge equilibration for scalable machine learning potentials involving systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms.</details> |

Pryce et.al. | [2503.21078](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21078) |  | 25 pages | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem $\dot x = f(t,x)$, $x(t_0) = x_0$, computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable step size.   A standard ODE method (e.g. Runge-Kutta) treats function $f$ as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires $f$ to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS.   The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger step sizes.   For a standard function, such as $\exp$, this means evaluating $v(t)=\exp(u(t))$, where $u(t),v(t)$ are TS.   The sub-ODE method applies the ODE $d v/d u=v$, obeyed by $v=\exp(u)$, to in-line this operation as $\dot v=v\dot u$.   This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the "Taylor library" with a few lines of code--not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach.   Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients.   We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into $f$ , this approach guarantees a sound system.   We introduce our sub-ODE-based Matlab ODE solver and show that its performance compares favorably with solvers from the Matlab ODE suite.</details> |

Bolhuis, Roberto Covino et.al. | [2503.21037](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21037) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.</details> |

When entire ground and excited potential energy surfaces (PESs) are desired, e.g., to predict the interaction of light excitation and structural changes, one is often forced to use cheaper computational methods at the cost of reduced accuracy. Here we introduce a novel method for the geometrically transferable optimization of neural network wave functions that leverages weight sharing and dynamical ordering of electronic states. Our method enables the efficient prediction of ground and excited-state PESs and their intersections at the highest accuracy, demonstrating up to two orders of magnitude cost reduction compared to single-point calculations. We validate our approach on three challenging excited-state PESs, including ethylene, the carbon dimer, and the methylenimmonium cation, indicating that transferable deep-learning QMC can pave the way towards highly accurate simulation of excited-state dynamics.</details> |

However, these systems often exhibit complex surface reconstructions and polymorphism, with properties influenced by kinetic processes and dynamic behavior. A lack of accurate and scalable simulation tools has limited computational modeling of surfaces and interfaces. Recently, machine learning and data-driven methods have expanded the capabilities of theoretical modeling, enabling, for example, the routine use of machine-learned interatomic potentials to predict energies and forces across numerous structures. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, including the scarcity of large, consistent datasets and the need for computational and data-efficient machine learning methods. Additionally, a major challenge lies in the lack of accurate reference data and electronic structure methods for interfaces. Density Functional Theory, while effective for bulk materials, is less reliable for surfaces, and too few accurate experimental studies on interface structure and stability exist. Here, we will sketch the current state of data-driven methods and machine learning in computational surface science and provide a perspective on how these methods will shape the field in the future.</details> |

However, such methods have traditionally been applied to static, deterministic loading, in which modulus, position and direction are known and invariant. This is against the probabilistic load combination used in the structural engineering designs, and entails two important shortcomings.   The first one is related to maintenance and reliability: static loading fails to consider naturally occurring uncertainties in the loading process, measurements or regular service; also ignoring (quantitatively) unforeseen phenomena such as vibrations, and the material's behavior is assumed linear isotropic, ignoring fatigue, plasticity and anisotropy in functionally-graded materials. The second one concerns optimality itself: often times, the structure presented as "optimal" in fact over-estimates loading and thus wastes material by exceeding its real needs and/or distributing it poorly throughout the design dominion.   In this article, a probabilistic framework is presented: uncertain and pseudo-dynamic loading is introduced to create robust topologies via a reinforced SIMP scheme with embedded penalization addressing fatigue damage, layer direction, mechanical response (traction/compression) and yield limit (von Mises equivalent stress). This computationally efficient framework is applied to various loading scenarios, generating diverse designs for the same volume fraction constraint with improved and more realistic performances. Under the proposed method, if loads are permanent and damage isotropic, the methodology converges to the traditional (deterministic) topological optimization results. Future ramifications of this work are pondered, especially regarding metamaterial design.</details> |

We find new closed-form expressions for memory and prediction functions of linear time-delayed reservoirs in terms of the power spectrum of the input and the reservoir transfer function. We confirm this relationship numerically for some time-delayed reservoirs using simulations, including when the reservoir can be linearized but is actually nonlinear. Finally, we use these closed-form formulae to address the utility of multiple time delays in linear reservoirs in order to perform memory and prediction, finding similar results to previous work on nonlinear reservoirs. We hope these closed-form formulae can be used to understand memory and predictive capabilities in time-delayed reservoirs.</details> |

Defeaturing consists in removing features from complex domains in order to ease the meshing process, and to reduce the computational burden of simulations. It is a common procedure, for example, in computer aided design for simulation based manufacturing. However, depending on the problem at hand, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the solution may be detrimental. The proposed adaptive strategy is hence twofold: starting from a defeatured geometry it allows both for standard mesh refinement and geometrical refinement, which consists in choosing, at each step, which features need to be included into the geometry in order to significantly increase the accuracy of the solution. With respect to other estimators that were previously proposed in the context of defeaturing, the use of an equilibrated flux reconstruction allows us to avoid the evaluation of the numerical flux on the boundary of features. This makes the estimator and the adaptive strategy particularly well-suited for finite element discretizations, in which the numerical flux is typically discontinuous across element edges. The inclusion of the features during the adaptive process is tackled by a CutFEM strategy, in order to preserve the non conformity of the mesh to the feature boundary and never remesh the computational domain as the features are added. Hence, the estimator also accounts for the error introduced by weakly imposing the boundary conditions on the boundary of the added features.</details> |

In this work, we present the methodology for calculation of carrier relaxation times and electrical transport properties without the use of a predefined grid. The relaxation times are evaluated by integrating out the delta function that ensures energy conservation and performing an average over the angular components of phonon momentum. The charge carrier mobility is then evaluated as a sum over appropriately sampled electronic momenta. We illustrate our methodology by applying to the Fr{\"o}hlich model and to a real semiconducting material ZnTe. We find that rather accurate results can be obtained with a modest number of electron and phonon momenta, on the order of one hundred each, regardless of the carrier effective mass.</details> |

Here, we analyzed SNs of $33$ Indian cities to explore how the spatial embedding and the planarity jointly shape their topology. Overall, we found that all the studied SNs have small-world properties with higher clustering and efficiency. The efficiency of the empirical networks is even higher than that of the corresponding degree of preserved random networks. This increased efficiency can be explained by Dijkstra's path-length distribution, which closely fits a right-skewed normal or log-normal distribution. Moreover, we observed that the connectivity of the streets is length-dependent: the smaller streets connect preferably to the smaller streets, while longer streets tend to connect with the longer counterparts. This length-dependent connectivity is more profound in the empirical SNs than in the corresponding degree preserved random and random planar networks. However, planar networks maintaining the empirical spatial coordinates replicate the connectivity behavior of empirical SNs, highlighting the influence of spatial embedding. Moreover, the robustness of the cities in terms of resilience to random errors and targeted attacks is independent of the SN's size, indicating other factors, such as geographical constraints, substantially influence network stability.</details> |

Unlike the residual type error estimators, one can not establish upper and lower a posteriori error bounds for the classical recovery type error estimators without the saturation assumption. In this paper, we first present three examples to show the unsatisfactory performance in the practice of standard residual or recovery-type error estimators, then, an improved gradient recovery-based a posteriori error estimator is constructed. The proposed error estimator contains two parts, one is the difference between the direct and post-processed gradient approximations, and the other is the residual of the recovered gradient. The reliability and efficiency of the enhanced estimator are derived. Based on the improved recovery-based error estimator and the newest-vertex bisection refinement method with a tailored mark strategy, an adaptive finite element algorithm is designed. We then prove the convergence of the adaptive method by establishing the contraction of gradient error plus oscillation. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the asymptotic exactness of the new recovery-based a posteriori error estimator and the high efficiency of the corresponding adaptive algorithm.</details> |

A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits.

CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.</details> |

A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</details> |

This study explores the use of Optimization by Prompting, an iterative approach utilizing large language models (LLMs), to address these challenges. The method is straightforward to implement, requiring no hyperparameter tuning or complex mathematical formulations. Optimization problems can be described in plain English, with only an evaluator and a parsing script needed for execution. The in-context learning capabilities of LLMs enable them to understand problem nuances, therefore, they have the potential to surpass traditional metaheuristic optimization methods. This study demonstrates the application of LLMs as optimizers to Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel lattice design, showing the capability of commercial LLMs to achieve superior optimization results compared to traditional methods.</details> |

We first formulate the diffusive relaxation system based on the even-odd decomposition method, which allows us to split into one relaxation step and one transport step. We adopt a robust implicit scheme that can be explicitly implemented for the relaxation step that involves the stiffness of the collision term, while the third-order strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method is employed for the transport step. We couple this temporal scheme with the DG method for spatial discretization, which provides additional advantages including high-order accuracy, $h$-$p$ adaptivity, and the ability to handle arbitrary unstructured meshes. A positivity-preserving limiter is further applied to preserve physical properties of numerical solutions. The stability analysis using the even-odd decomposition is conducted for the first time. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme through several numerical examples.</details> |

However, the computational costs of this so-called FE $^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.   The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.</details> |

This work has been accepted for publication in Numerical   Methods for Partial Differential Equations | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>We present a kernel compensation method for Maxwell eigenproblem for photonic crystals to avoid the infinite-dimensional kernels that cause many difficulties in the calculation of energy gaps. The quasi-periodic problem is first transformed into a periodic one on the cube by the Floquet-Bloch theory. Then the compensation operator is introduced in Maxwell's equation with the shifted curl operator. The discrete problem depends on the compatible discretization of the de Rham complex, which is implemented by the mimetic finite difference method in this paper. We prove that the compensation term exactly fills up the kernel of the original problem and avoids spurious eigenvalues. Also, we propose an efficient preconditioner and its FFT and multigrid solvers, which allow parallel computing. Numerical experiments for different three-dimensional lattices are performed to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the method.</details> |

Approximating such solutions in the stochastic setting is particularly challenging due to randomized frequency interactions and presents a compelling challenge for the construction of tailored schemes. In particular, we design the first resonance-based schemes for this equation, which achieve provable convergence for solutions of much lower regularity than previously required. A crucial ingredient in this construction is the Wong--Zakai approximation of stochastic dispersive system, which introduces piecewise linear phases that capture nonlinear frequency interactions and can subsequently be approximated to construct resonance-based schemes. We prove the well-posedness of the Wong--Zakai approximated equation and establish its proximity to the original full stochastic dispersive system. Based on this approximation, we demonstrate an improved strong convergence rate for our new scheme, which exploits the stochastic nature of the dispersive terms. Finally, we provide numerical experiments underlining the favourable performance of our novel method in practice.</details> |

Howard et.al. | [2503.19333](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19333) |  | 27 pages, 13 figures | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise as a framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress in the field, it remains challenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While approaches such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the \emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to B-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more efficient. This observation, combined with E-PINNs' more consistent uncertainty estimates and better calibration compared to Dropout-PINNs for the examples presented, indicates that E-PINNs offer a promising approach in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</details> |

In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger "Prony-Ritz equivalence class", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.</details> |

While current REV-scale models are able to reproduce the main features of laboratory experiments, they neglect effects like the formation of preferential flow paths and the appearance of multiple polymorphs of calcium carbonate with differing properties. We show that extending an existing EICP model by the conceptual assumption of a mobile precipitate, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), allows for the formation of preferential flow paths when the initial porosity is heterogeneous. We apply sensitivity analysis and Bayesian inference to gain an understanding of the influence of characteristic parameters of ACC that are uncertain or unknown and compare two variations of the model based on different formulations of the ACC detachment term to analyse the plausibility of our hypothesis. An arbitrary Polynomial Chaos (aPC) surrogate model is trained based on the full model and used to reduce the computational cost of this study.</details> |

However, HPC users are generally less aware of how these energy concerns influence the design, deployment, and operation of supercomputers even though they experience the consequences. This paper examines the implications of HPC's energy consumption, providing an overview of current trends aimed at improving energy efficiency. We describe how hardware innovations such as energy-efficient processors, novel system architectures, power management techniques, and advanced scheduling policies do have a direct impact on how applications need to be programmed and executed on HPC systems. For application developers, understanding how these new systems work and how to analyse and report the performances of their own software is critical in the dialog with HPC system designers and administrators. The paper aims to raise awareness about energy efficiency among users, particularly in the high energy physics and astrophysics domains, offering practical advice on how to analyse and optimise applications to reduce their energy consumption without compromising on performance.</details> |

We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</details> |

Although the theory for adaptive finite element methods based on residual-type a posteriori error estimator and bisection refinement has been well established, in practical computations, the use of non-asymptotic exact of error estimator and the excessive number of adaptive iteration steps often lead to inefficiency of the adaptive algorithm. We propose an efficient adaptive finite element method based on high-accuracy techniques including the superconvergence recovery technique and high-quality mesh optimization. The centroidal Voronoi Delaunay triangulation mesh optimization is embedded in the mesh adaption to provide high-quality mesh, and then assure that the superconvergence property of the recovered gradient and the asymptotical exactness of the error estimator. A tailored adaptive strategy, which could generate high-quality meshes with a target number of vertices, is developed to ensure the adaptive computation process terminated within $7$ steps. The effectiveness and robustness of the adaptive algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</details> |

In the Eulerian description fluid flow modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains in Eulerian coordinates, while elastic solids are transformed from Lagrangian coordinates into the Eulerian system. A monolithic description is adopted. For the spatial discretization, we employ an unfitted finite element method with ghost penalties based on inf-sup stable finite elements. To handle contact, we use a relaxation of the contact condition in combination with a unified Nitsche approach that takes care implicitly of the switch between fluid-structure interaction and contact conditions. The temporal discretization is based on a backward Euler scheme with implicit extensions of solutions at the previous time step. The nonlinear system is solved with a semi-smooth Newton's method with line search. Our formulation, discretization and implementation are substantiated with an elastic falling ball that comes into contact with the bottom boundary, constituting a challenging state-of-the-art benchmark.</details> |

We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous single vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal single vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications.

Previously, isothermal macroscale models have been derived to describe this material injection and the mechanical interactions which arise. However, the temperature of the injected cement is typically below the human body temperature, necessitating the extension of these models to the non-isothermal case. Following the modelling principles of the TPM and considering local thermal non-equilibrium conditions, our model introduces three energy balances as well as additional constitutive relations. If restricted to local thermal equilibrium conditions, our model equations are in agreement with other examples of TPM-based models. We observe that our model elicits physically reasonable behaviour in numerical simulations which employ parameter values and initial and boundary conditions relevant for our application. Noting that we neglect capillary effects, we claim our model to be thermodynamically consistent despite the employment of simplifying assumptions during its derivation, such as the Coleman and Noll procedure.</details> |

Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.</details> |

In this paper, we present a novel combined hybridized mixed discontinuous Galerkin (HMDG) finite element method to simulate the dissolution process near the wellbore, commonly referred to as the wormhole phenomenon. The primary contribution of this work lies in the application of hybridization techniques to both the pressure and concentration equations. Additionally, an upwind scheme is utilized to address convection-dominant scenarios, and a ``cut-off" operator is introduced to maintain the boundedness of porosity. Compared to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, the proposed approach results in a global system with fewer unknowns and sparser stencils, thereby significantly reducing computational costs.

Property-directed generative design has emerged as a transformative approach for rapidly discovering new functional inorganic materials with multiple desired properties within vast and complex search spaces. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: data scarcity for functional properties and the multi-objective optimization required to balance competing tasks. Here, we present a multi-property-directed generative framework designed to overcome these limitations and enhance site symmetry-compliant crystal generation beyond P1 (translational) symmetry. By incorporating Wyckoff-position-based data augmentation and transfer learning, our framework effectively handles sparse and small functional datasets, enabling the generation of new stable materials simultaneously conditioned on targeted space group, band gap, and formation energy. Using this approach, we identified previously unknown thermodynamically and lattice-dynamically stable semiconductors in tetragonal, trigonal, and cubic systems, with bandgaps ranging from 0.13 to 2.20 eV, as validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, we assessed their thermoelectric descriptors using DFT, indicating their potential suitability for thermoelectric applications. We believe our integrated framework represents a significant step forward in generative design of inorganic materials.</details> |

A key feature of this model is that reactions between different species occur only at the interface, and may induce deformation of the interface. For the governing equations derived based on the energy variational method, we propose a structure-preserving numerical scheme that satisfies the mass conservation and energy dissipation laws at the discrete level. Furthermore, we carry out a rigorous error analysis of the time-discrete scheme for a simplified case. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the model as well as the accuracy and stability of the scheme. In particular, we simulate microvessels with straight and bifurcated structures to illustrate the risk of microaneurysm formation.</details> |

Suggestions and comments are welcome | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>One of the mechanisms responsible for disk formation around the black holes is Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion.The fact that BHL accretion can be interrupted by various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar winds or astrophysical jets, makes it crucial to study the behavior of shock cones formed by BHL accretion around black holes once the accretion process is halted. Investigating the new plasma structures that emerge in these scenarios can provide insights into observational results. In this context, a new plasma structure forming around the Kerr black hole has been numerically modeled as a function of the black hole spin parameter and the asymptotic velocity of BHL accretion. The numerical analysis revealed that high spin (a/M=0.9) and supersonic flow ( M > 1) are necessary conditions for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) formation. On the other hand, the fundamental mode of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) are found to be independent of both the black hole spin and asymptotic velocity and are instead governed by general relativistic effects. Additionally, the study demonstrated that for 3:2 and 2:1 resonance states to form, nonlinear couplings needs to be occurred when the black hole rotates rapidly. These couplings produce harmonic frequencies, providing an explanation for the observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) resonances in black hole binaries. These findings align with precession models and nonlinear resonance models, both of which play a crucial role in QPO generation. Finally, the LFQPOs and HFQPOs obtained from numerical simulations are consistent with the observed QPO frequencies in the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564, as well as in the AGN REJ1034+396, which harbors a supermassive black hole at its center.</details> |

Using a multiplier method, we demonstrate that the resulting approximation model uniformly preserves the exponential stability of the uncontrolled system, establishing a lower bound for the exponential decay rate that is independent of the mesh size. This property is illustrated through the spatial discretization of a piezoelectric beam. Furthermore, we show how the uniform preservation of exponential stability by the proposed model aids in the convergence of controllers derived from an infinite-time linear quadratic control design, in comparison to models obtained from the standard finite-element method.</details> |

Altschuler, Jelena Diakonikolas et.al. | [2503.16312](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16312) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>In 1960, Osborne proposed a simple iterative algorithm for matrix balancing with outstanding numerical performance. Today, it is the default preconditioning procedure before eigenvalue computation and other linear algebra subroutines in mainstream software packages such as Python, Julia, MATLAB, EISPACK, LAPACK, and more. Despite its widespread usage, Osborne's algorithm has long resisted theoretical guarantees for its runtime: the first polynomial-time guarantees were obtained only in the past decade, and recent near-linear runtimes remain confined to variants of Osborne's algorithm with important differences that make them simpler to analyze but empirically slower. In this paper, we address this longstanding gap between theory and practice by proving that Osborne's original algorithm -- the de facto preconditioner in practice -- in fact has a near-linear runtime. This runtime guarantee (1) is optimal in the input size up to at most a single logarithm, (2) is the first runtime for Osborne's algorithm that does not dominate the runtime of downstream tasks like eigenvalue computation, and (3) improves upon the theoretical runtimes for all other variants of Osborne's algorithm.</details> |

Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</details> |

Additionally, a carefully designed shift strategy and several algorithmic improvements make the implementation comparable in performance to highly optimized self-consistent field iterations. The energy-adaptive Riemannian conjugate gradient method has a sound mathematical foundation, including stability and convergence, offering a reliable and efficient alternative for DFT-based electronic structure calculations in computational chemistry.</details> |

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | On the convergence of split exponential integrators for semilinear parabolic problems | Marco Caliari, Fabio Cassini, Lukas Einkemmer et.al. | [2503.16210](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16210) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Splitting the exponential-like $\varphi$ functions, which typically appear in exponential integrators, is attractive in many situations since it can dramatically reduce the computational cost of the procedure. However, depending on the employed splitting, this can result in order reduction. The aim of this paper is to analyze different such split approximations. We perform the analysis for semilinear problems in the abstract framework of commuting semigroups and derive error bounds that depend, in particular, on whether the vector (to which the $\varphi$ functions are applied) satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. We then present the convergence analysis for two split versions of a second-order exponential Runge--Kutta integrator in the context of analytic semigroups, and show that one suffers from order reduction while the other does not. Numerical results for semidiscretized parabolic PDEs confirm the theoretical findings.</details> |

In the first part of the paper we prove that square root Lasso $({\tt rLasso})$ with a particular choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda>0$ as well as orthogonal matching pursuit $({\tt OMP})$ after sufficiently many iterations provide noise blind decoders which efficiently recover multivariate functions from random samples. In contrast to basis pursuit the decoders $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ do not require any additional information on the width of the function class in $L_\infty$ and lead to instance optimal recovery guarantees. In the second part of the paper we relate the findings to linear recovery methods such as least squares $({\tt Lsqr})$ or Smolyak's algorithm $({\tt Smolyak})$ and compare the performance in a model situation, namely periodic multivariate functions with $L_p$-bounded mixed derivative will be approximated in $L_q$. The main observation is the fact, that $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ outperform Smolyak's algorithm (sparse grids) in various situations, where $1<p<2\leq q<\infty$. For $q=2$ they even outperform any linear method including $({\tt Lsqr})$ in combination with recently proposed subsampled random points.</details> |

In GASS, the deployment of AVs is crucial to ensure overall performance from GUs to satellites. This paper develops a stochastic geometry-based analytical model for GASS under Matern hard-core point process (MHCPP) distributed AVs. The 3D distributions of AVs and GUs are modeled by considering their locations on spherical surfaces in the presence of high-altitude satellites. Accordingly, we derive an overall connectivity analytical model for GASS, which includes the average performance of AV-relayed two-hop transmissions. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of the connectivity model and provide essential insights for configuring AV deployments.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | An interior penalty DG method with correct and minimal averages, jumps and penalties for the miscible displacement problem of nonnegative characteristic form, and SUPG-type error estimates under low regularity, dominating Darcy velocity | Zhijie Du, Huoyuan Duan, Roger C E Tan et.al. | [2503.16196](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16196) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>An interior penalty DG method is proposed for the steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form, suitable for mixed second-order elliptic-parabolic and first-order hyperbolic equations. Due to the different natures of the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. In the new DG method, the averages, jumps and penalties are minimal, correctly and only imposed on the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries, in addition to the well-known upwind jumps associating with the advection velocity. For the advection-dominated problem, the penalties can be further reduced only being imposed on the diffusion-dominated subset of the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries.This is based on the novel, crucial technique about the multiple partitions of the set of the interelement boundaries into a number of subsets with respect to the diffusion and to the advection and on the consistency result we have proven. The new DG method is the first DG method and the first time that the continuity and discontinuity of the solution are correctly identified and justified of the general steady-state linear partial differential equations of nonnegative characteristic form. The new DG method and its analysis are applied to the miscible displacement problem of vanishing diffusion coefficient and of low regularity, dominating Darcy flow velocity which lives in $H(\operatorname{div};\Omega)\cap \prod_{j=1}^J (H^r(D_j))^d$ for $r<1$ other than the usual assumption $(W^{1,\infty}(\Omega))^d$. We prove the SUPG-type error estimates $\mathcal{O}(h^{\ell+\frac{1}{2}})$ for any element polynomial of degree $\ell\ge 1$ on generally shaped and nonconforming meshes, where the convergence order is independent of the regularity of the advection velocity. The SUPG-type error estimates obtained are new and the first time known under the low regularity of the advection velocity.</details> |

If furthermore that pair of M-eigenvectors is positive, then that M$^+$-eigenvalue is called an M$^{++}$-eigenvalue. A nonnegative biquadratic tensor always has at least one M$^+$ eigenvalue, and the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue is also the largest M-eigenvalue and the M-spectral radius. In the case of an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, all the M$^+$-eigenvalues are M$^{++}$-eigenvalues. Although the M$^+$-eigenvalues of irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensors are not unique in general, we establish a sufficient condition to ensure their uniqueness. For an irreducible nonnegative biquadratic tensor, the largest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a max-min characterization, while the smallest M$^+$-eigenvalue has a min-max characterization. A Collatz algorithm for computing the largest M$^+$ -eigenvalues is proposed. Numerical results are reported.</details> |

We compute the spin-dependent cross section within collinear twist-3 factorization in perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In this approach, multiparton correlations generate a non-vanishing effect. For the present paper, we focus on correlations in the nucleon initial-state rather than in the fragmentation process. We explicitly verify that collinear twist-3 factorization is valid at the one-loop level. Our analytical results show that at NLO the relevant multiparton correlation functions in the nucleon are probed on their full support in momentum fractions. Our numerical analysis for collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider indicates that the NLO corrections can be large and are sensitive to the functional form of the twist-3 correlation functions.</details> |

We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range.   Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.</details> |

Vortices, characterized by circular in-plane magnetization (chirality) and out-of-plane core polarization, naturally arise in confined geometries due to the interplay between exchange and dipolar interactions. In contrast, skyrmions typically require the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for stabilization and exhibit fixed chirality-polarity relationships. Through micromagnetic simulations, we reveal that these seemingly distinct topological states can coexist, forming a novel composite state termed the \textit{n}-skyrmion vortex, which represents a skyrmion-embedded vortex state. These composite states possess quantized topological charges $Q$ that follow the relation $Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{vortex}} + nQ_{\text{skyrmion}}$, where $n$ denotes the number of embedded skyrmions. Similar to vortices, these states exhibit independent chirality and polarity and are energetically degenerate.</details> |

It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$ . It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</details> |

In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</details> |

As an example, we consider situations where noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of optimal scalar regularisation.</details> |

The implementation of the package is PDE agnostic, meaning that the same code can be used to solve a wide range of equations, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady and unsteady problems. We highlight the main innovations of ROManifolds, we detail its implementation principles, we introduce its building blocks by providing usage examples, and we solve a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3d geometry.</details> |
| 2025-03-20 | Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory for Periodic Solids: Construction of the Pauli Potential | Sangita Majumdar, Zekun Shi, Giovanni Vignale et.al. | [2503.15959](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15959) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>The practical success of density functional theory (DFT) is largely credited to the Kohn-Sham approach, which enables the exact calculation of the non-interacting electron kinetic energy via an auxiliary noninteracting system. Yet, the realization of DFT's full potential awaits the discovery of a direct link between the electron density, $n$, and the non-interacting kinetic energy, $T_{S}[n]$. In this work, we address two key challenges towards this objective. First, we introduce a new algorithm for directly solving the constrained minimization problem yielding $T_{S}[n]$ for periodic densities -- a class of densities that, in spite of its central importance for materials science, has received limited attention in the literature. Second, we present a numerical procedure that allows us to calculate the functional derivative of $T_{S}[n]$ with respect to the density at constant electron number, also known as the Kohn-Sham potential $V_{S}[n](\rv)$. Lastly, the algorithm is augmented with a subroutine that computes the ``derivative discontinuity", i.e., the spatially uniform jump in $V_{S}[n](\rv)$ which occurs upon increasing or decreasing the total number of electrons. This feature allows us to distinguish between ``insulating" and ``conducting" densities for non interacting electrons. The code integrates key methodological innovations, such as the use of an adaptive basis set (``equidensity orbitals") for wave function expansion and the QR decomposition to accelerate the implementation of the orthogonality constraint. Notably, we derive a closed-form expression for the Pauli potential in one dimension, expressed solely in terms of the input density, without relying on Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We validate this method on one-dimensional periodic densities, achieving results within ``chemical accuracy".</details> |

Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis) and investigated samples possess the MgCu$_{2}$-type single phase with Fd-3m space group. Melt-spinning process introduced a chemical and topological disorder, which directly affected the magnetic properties. Refrigerant capacity (RC), strictly connected to the full width at half maximum $\delta$TFWHM of the $\Delta$S$_M$(T) curve and the maximum of magnetic entropy changes $\Delta$S$_{Mpk}$(T)(T,$\Delta$H), increases from 29 to 148 J/kg with replacement of Y by Gd atoms from x = 0.2 to x = 0.8. RC and $\delta$TFWHM indicate the presence of disorder. Temperature dependences of magnetic entropy change $\Delta$S$_M$(T,$\Delta$H) and RC were measured in as-quenched and annealed state for Y$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.6}$Co$_{2}$. This particular composition was chosen for detailed investigation mainly due to its Curie point (T$_C$ = 282 K), which is close to the room temperature. After isothermal annealing ($\tau_a$ = 60 min, Ta = 700$^o$C) RC decreased from 122 to 104 J/kg, which clearly indicates the homogenization of the heat treated sample. Furthermore, observed inverse magnetocaloric effect is associated with the presence of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd and Co magnetic moments. The phase transition temperature increases with increasing Gd content from 74 to 407 K for Y$_{0.8}$Gd$_{0.2}$Co$_{2}$ and GdCo2, respectively. Within the FPLO-LDA DFT method, the non-magnetic ground state for YCo$_{2}$ and the magnetic ground state for GdCo$_{2}$ are predicted in agreement with experiment. The dependence of calculated total and species-resolved magnetic moments on Gd concentration reasonably agrees with available experimental data.</details> |

This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ans\"atze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</details> |

Under such a design, we show that a piecewise smooth function, even with a large number of pieces, can be approximated by a single neural network with high prediction accuracy. We then leverage the proposed network model to solve anisotropic elliptic interface problems. The network is trained by minimizing the mean squared error loss of the system. Our results show that, despite its simple and shallow structure, the proposed neural network model exhibits comparable efficiency and accuracy to traditional grid-based numerical methods.</details> |

However, most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects and dopants break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Addressing these challenges requires models that are able to capture sparse defect-driven effects in crystals while maintaining adaptability and precision. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. Trained on 14,866 defect structures, DefiNet achieves highly accurate structural predictions in a single step, avoiding the time-consuming iterative processes in modern ML relaxation models and possible error accumulation from iteration. We further validates DefiNet's accuracy by using density functional theory (DFT) relaxation on DefiNet-predicted structures. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a groundbreaking tool for defect-focused materials research.</details> |

Kasilov et.al. | [2503.15278](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15278) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Symplectic integrators with long-term preservation of integrals of motion are introduced for the guiding-center model of plasma particles in toroidal magnetic fields of general topology. An efficient transformation to canonical coordinates from cylindrical and flux-like coordinates is discussed and applied using one component of the magnetic vector potential as a spatial coordinate. This choice is efficient in both, theoretical and numerical developments and marks a generalization of magnetic flux coordinates. The transformation enables the application of conventional symplectic integration schemes formulated in canonical coordinates, as well as variational integrators on the guiding-center system, without requiring magnetic flux coordinates. Symplectic properties and superior efficiency of the implicit midpoint scheme compared to conventional non-symplectic methods are demonstrated on perturbed tokamak fields with magnetic islands and stochastic regions. The presented results mark a crucial step towards gyrokinetic models that conserve physical invariants.</details> |

As an example, we derive structured generalizations of the HSS (Hermitian/skew-Hermitian) iteration, and provide sufficient conditions for their convergence.</details> |

This study aims to enhance the accuracy of SPH method and analyze its convergence with irregular particle distributions. By establishing regularity conditions for particle distributions, we ensure that the local truncation error of traditional SPH formulations, including first and second derivatives, achieves second-order accuracy. Our proposed method, the volume reconstruction SPH method, guarantees these regularity conditions while preserving the discrete maximum principle. Benefiting from the discrete maximum principle, we conduct a rigorous global error analysis in the $L^\infty$ -norm for the Poisson equation with variable coefficients, achieving second-order convergence. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings.</details> |

However, the high computational cost of MBD calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies. Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.</details> |

However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</details> |
| 2025-03-19 | Efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems based on dimension reduction and Kriging surrogate modeling in functional space | Zhouzhou Song, Weiyun Xu, Marcos A. Valdebenito et.al. | [2503.15077](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15077) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Surrogate models are extensively employed for forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in complex, computation-intensive engineering problems. Nonetheless, constructing high-accuracy surrogate models for complex dynamical systems with limited training samples continues to be a challenge, as capturing the variability in high-dimensional dynamical system responses with a small training set is inherently difficult. This study introduces an efficient Kriging modeling framework based on functional dimension reduction (KFDR) for conducting forward and inverse uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems. By treating the responses of dynamical systems as functions of time, the proposed KFDR method first projects these responses onto a functional space spanned by a set of predefined basis functions, which can deal with noisy data by adding a roughness regularization term. A few key latent functions are then identified by solving the functional eigenequation, mapping the time-variant responses into a low-dimensional latent functional space. Subsequently, Kriging surrogate models with noise terms are constructed in the latent space. With an inverse mapping established from the latent space to the original output space, the proposed approach enables accurate and efficient predictions for dynamical systems. Finally, the surrogate model derived from KFDR is directly utilized for efficient forward and inverse uncertainty quantification of the dynamical system. Through three numerical examples, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to construct highly accurate surrogate models and perform uncertainty quantification for dynamical systems accurately and efficiently.</details> |

At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\"odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.</details> |

The X-ray diffraction indicates multiphase character of the samples, with the majority of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type structures of (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phase. Partial substitutions of La by Gd or Ni by Co in La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phase result in increase of cycle stability of the metal hydride (MH$_x$ ) electrodes. All considered alloys reach the maximum discharge capacity after three charging-discharging cycles.

In this work, we investigate the effect of Mg substitution on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ materials. The mechanical alloying technique is used to produce a series of La$_{2-x}$Mg$_x$Ni$_7$ alloys ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75). The X-ray diffraction measurements indicate multiphase character of the samples with majority (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phases of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type. Electrochemical measurements show how the maximum discharge capacity ($C_{max}$) increases with Mg concentration and that reach the highest value of 304 mAh/g for La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.5). The experimental efforts are followed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed with the full-potential local-orbital minimum-basis scheme (FPLO). To simulate chemical disorder, we use the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The calculations are focused on the La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ composition with the highest measured value of $C_{max}$. Additionally, several other structures are considered as reference points. We find that hexagonal and rhombohedral structures of La$_2$Ni$_7$ have almost identical total energies, which is in a good agreement with a coexistence of both phases in the samples. The calculated site preferences of Mg in both Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phases are consistent with the previous experimental data. Furthermore, the valence band of the nanocrystalline La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ sample is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental XPS are interpreted based on the corresponding spectra calculated with DFT.</details> |

This method contains three steps: (1) train a PINN and obtain an approximate solution $u_{\theta}$; (2) enrich the finite element space with $u_{\theta}$; (3) obtain the final solution by FEM in the enriched space. In the second step, the enriched space is constructed by addition $v + u_{\theta}$ or multiplication $v \cdot u_{\theta}$, where $v$ belongs to the standard finite element space. We conduct the convergence analysis for the proposed method. Compared to the standard FEM, the same convergence order is obtained and higher accuracy can be achieved when solution derivatives are well approximated in PINN. Numerical examples from one dimension to three dimensions verify these theoretical results. For some examples, the accuracy of the proposed method can be reduced by a couple of orders of magnitude compared to the standard FEM.</details> |

Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</details> |

As it is well known, SL schemes are not well suited for unstructured grids, due to the cost of the point location phase; this drawback is augmented by the need for repeated minimization. In this work, we propose a scheme that works only on the basis of node values and connectivity of the grid. In a first version, we obtain a monotone scheme; then, applying a quadratic refinement to the numerical solution, we improve accuracy at the price of some extra computational cost. The scheme can be applied to both time-dependent and stationary HJ equations; in the latter case, we also study the construction of a fast policy iteration solver. We perform a theoretical analysis of the two versions, and validate them with an extensive set of examples, both in the time-dependent and in the stationary case.</details> |

The aim is to reconstruct the model parameters from stress data acquired from a relaxation experiment, where the number of Maxwell elements, and thus the number of material parameters themselves, are assumed to be unknown. This implies that the forward operator acts on a Cartesian product of a semigroup (of integers) and a Hilbert space and demands for an extension of existing regularization theory. We develop a stable reconstruction procedure by applying Bayesian inversion to this setting. We use an appropriate binomial prior which takes the integer setting for the number of Maxwell elements into account and at the same time computes the underlying material parameters. We extend the regularization theory for inverse problems to this special setup and prove existence, stability and convergence of the computed solution. The theoretical results are evaluated by extensive numerical tests.</details> |

To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.</details> |

Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</details> |

In the case of a cubic nonlinearity, we show almost second-order convergence in $L^2$ and almost first-order convergence in $H^1$ . If the nonlinearity has a quartic form instead, we show an analogous convergence result with an order reduced by 1/2. To our knowledge these are the best convergence results available for the 3D cubic and quartic wave equations under the finite-energy condition. Our approach relies on continuous- and discrete-time Strichartz estimates. We also make use of the integration and summation by parts formulas to exploit cancellations in the error terms. Moreover, error bounds for a full discretization using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space are given. Finally, we discuss a numerical example indicating the sharpness of our theoretical results.</details> |

Our approach is based on a convex combination of two numerical flows, both of which are constructed from positivity preserving methods. The strong convergence of the Euler version of the method is proven to be of order $\tfrac{1}{2}$ , and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate that, in some cases, first-order convergence is observed in practice. We compare the Euler and Milstein versions of these new methods to existing domain preservation methods in the literature and observe our methods are robust, more widely applicable and that the error constant is in most cases superior.</details> |

However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong short-term forecasting capabilities with time-domain decomposition techniques. Our approach segments the time domain of the dynamical system, independently constructing snapshot matrices and performing localized predictions within each segment. We first introduce a localized DMD method with predefined partitioning, which is simple to implement, and then extend it to an adaptive partitioning strategy that enhances prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for our method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to four benchmark problems: Burgers' equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that our method significantly improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.</details> |

However, the process can be streamlined by neglecting the engineering insight in favor of automatic de-termination of structure geometry. In this work, a specification-oriented design of topologically agnostic antenna is considered. The radiator is developed using a bi-stage algorithm that involves min-max classification of randomly-generated topologies followed by local tuning of the promising designs using a trust-region optimization applied to a feature-based representation of the structure frequency response. The automatically generated antenna is characterized by -10 dB bandwidth of over 600 MHz w.r.t. the center frequency of 6.5 GHz and a dual-lobe radiation pattern. The obtained performance figures make the radiator of use for in-door positioning applications. The design method has been favorably compared against the frequency-based trust-region optimization.</details> |

However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm $^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</details> |

Trust-region (TR) methods coupled with data-efficient surrogates based on finite differentiation (FD) represent a popular class of antenna design algorithms. However, TR performance is subject to FD setup, which is normally determined a priori based on rules-of-thumb. In this work, the effect of FD perturbations on the performance of TR-based design is evaluated on a case study basis concerning a total of 80 optimizations of a planar antenna structure. The obtained results demonstrate that, for the considered radiator, the performance of the final designs obtained using different FD setups may vary by as much as 18 dB (and by over 4 dB on average). At the same time, the a priori perturbations in a range between 1.5% and 3% (w.r.t. the initial design) seem to be suitable for maintaining (relatively) consistent and high-quality results.</details> |

From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</details> |

Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</details> |

Various numerical tools and software packages have been developed with this purpose in mind, typically utilizing the harmonic oscillator basis or the charge basis to represent a Hamiltonian. In this work, we instead consider the use of discrete variable representations (DVRs) to model superconducting circuits. In particular, we use `sinc DVRs' of both charge number and phase to approximate the eigenenergies of several prototypical examples, exploring their use and effectiveness in the numerical analysis of superconducting circuits. We find that not only are these DVRs capable of achieving decoherence-accurate simulation, i.e., accuracy at the resolution of experiments subject to decay, decoherence, and dephasing, they also demonstrate improvements in efficiency with smaller basis sizes and better convergence over standard approaches, showing that DVRs are an advantageous alternative for representing superconducting circuits.</details> |

Based on the formulation of the DLRA equations as Friedrichs' systems in a continuous setting, it combines recently proposed conservative DLRA methods with a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. The resulting scheme is shown to ensure mass and momentum conservation at the discrete level. In addition, a new formulation of the conservative integrator is proposed which facilitates a projector splitting integrator. Numerical experiments validate our approach in one- and two-dimensional simulations of Landau damping. As a demonstration of feasibility, it is also shown that the rank-adaptive unconventional integrator can be combined with mesh adaptivity.</details> |

These immune cells are attracted to the wound after an injury and they move showing both directional and random motion. Thus, first, we smooth the trajectories and we separate the random from the directional parts of the motion. The smoothing model is based on curve evolution where the curve motion is influenced by the smoothing term and the attracting term. Once we obtain the random sub-trajectories, we analyze them using the mean squared displacement to characterize the type of diffusion. Finally, we compute the velocities on the smoothed trajectories and use them as sparse samples to reconstruct the wound attractant field. To do that, we consider a minimization problem for the vector components and lengths, which leads to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet conditions for the sparse samples and zero Neumann boundary conditions on the domain boundary.</details> |

In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$ -factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</details> |

To address the multiscale nature of the sediment distribution, we treat it as an inhomogeneous random field and use the homogenization theory in deriving the effective medium model. The inverse problem is formulated as the reconstruction of the effective medium model, specifically, the sediment concentration, from partial boundary measurements. Additionally, we develop numerical algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of solving this inverse problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods in producing accurate sediment concentration estimates, offering new insights into sediment concentration measurement in complex environments.</details> |

This method intermittently integrates the general synthetic iterative scheme with the shear stress transport turbulence model into the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach, enabling the simulation of gas flows across the free-molecular, transition, slip, and turbulent regimes. First, the macroscopic synthetic equations, derived directly from DSMC, are coupled with the turbulence model to establish a constitutive relation that incorporates not only turbulent and laminar transport coefficients but also higher-order terms accounting for rarefaction effects. Second, the macroscopic properties, statistically sampled over specific time intervals in DSMC, along with the turbulent properties provided by the turbulence model, serve as initial conditions for solving the macroscopic synthetic equations. Finally, the simulation particles in DSMC are updated based on the macroscopic properties obtained from the synthetic equations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method asymptotically converges to either the turbulence model or DSMC results, adaptively adjusting to different flow regimes. Then, this coupling method is applied to simulate an opposing jet surrounded by hypersonic rarefied gas flows, revealing significant variations in surface properties due to the interplay of turbulent and rarefied effects. This study presents an efficient methodology for simulating the complex interplay between rarefied and turbulent flows, establishing a foundational framework for investigating the coupled effects of turbulence, hypersonic conditions, and chemical reactions in rarefied gas dynamics in the future.</details> |

The formulation is provided in matrix notation in detail. The use of a director vector, as opposed to multi-parameter shell models, significantly reduces the computational cost by minimizing the number of degrees of freedom. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of the spectral element method (SEM) in combination with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature regarding the computational costs to generate the element stiffness matrix. To assess the performance of the new formulation for large deformation analysis, we compare it to three other numerical methods. One of these methods is a non-isoparametric SEM shell using the geometry definition of isogeometric analysis (IGA), while the other two are IGA shell formulations which differ in the rotation interpolation. All formulations base on Rodrigues' rotation tensor. Through the solution of various challenging numerical examples, it is demonstrated that although IGA benefits from an exact geometric representation, its influence on solution accuracy is less significant than that of shape function characteristics and rotational formulations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed SEM shell, despite its simpler rotational formulation, can produce results comparable to the most accurate and complex version of IGA. Finally, we discuss the optimal SEM strategy, emphasizing the effectiveness of employing coarser meshes with higher-order elements.</details> |

| 2025-03-13 | Thermal Management of Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Comparative Study of Phase Change Materials and Air-Cooling Systems Equipped with Fins | Masoumeh Karimi Kisomi et.al. | [2503.10244](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10244) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>Lithium-ion batteries are extensively utilized as the primary power source for electric vehicles due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness and lightweight nature. However, their performance and safety are highly dependent on operating temperature. Therefore, a battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential to ensure the reliable operation and safety of electric vehicles. This study presents a battery thermal management system incorporating phase change material (PCM) and air cooling in a cylindrical lithium-ion cell with fins to enhance heat dissipation. The effects of each system on maximum and minimum temperature, and temperature uniformity along the battery cell are analyzed. Additionally, the impact of fins in both systems is evaluated against a finless cell. A numerical analysis utilizing ANSYS software and the finite volume method (FVM) is performed to evaluate the cooling performance of the systems. The results show that PCM reduces both the maximum and minimum temperatures compared to the air cooling system due to the phase change mechanism. In the finless battery case, the maximum temperature decreases from 316 K to 304 K when using PCM instead of the air cooling system. Also, in the same fin-based battery, the minimum temperature decreases from 307 K to 302 K by using PCM instead of the air cooling system, leading to improved temperature stability. The results indicate that, in general, the fins help reduce the maximum cell temperature when compared to the case without fins in both cases. Using rectangular fins reduces the maximum temperature by approximately 3% compared to a finless battery in the air cooling system. Additionally, the presence of fins reduces the temperature difference along the battery, ensuring a more uniform temperature distribution, such that, in the PCM system with rectangular fins, the temperature difference remains below 1 K.</details> |

However, Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation may become unstable when handling data from diverse distributions (e.g., solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)). Additionally, Monte Carlo sampling methods are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage optimization method based on optimal control theory and variational Bayesian methods. This method not only achieves stable solutions for stochastic inverse problems but also efficiently quantifies the uncertainty of the solutions. In the first stage, we introduce a new weighting formulation to ensure the stability of the Bayesian MAP estimation. In the second stage, we derive the necessary condition to efficiently quantify the uncertainty of the solutions, by combining the new weighting formula with variational inference. Furthermore, we establish an error estimation theorem that relates the exact solution to the optimally estimated solution under different amounts of observed data. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.</details> |

Our findings are derived from the application of multilinear estimates established within the framework of discrete Bourgain spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the solution $(E,z,z_t) \in H^{s+r+1/2}\times H^{s+r}\times H^{s+r-1}$, the error in $H^{r+1/2}\times H^{r}\times H^{r-1}$ is $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{s/2})$ for $s\in(0,2]$, where $r=\max(0,\frac d2-1)$ . To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first explicit error estimate for the splitting method based on the original Zakharov system, as well as the first instance where low regularity error estimates for coupled equations have been considered within the Bourgain framework. Furthermore, numerical experiments confirm the validity of our theoretical results.</details> |
| 2025-03-13 | Surrogate modeling of resonant behavior in scattering problems through adaptive rational approximation and sketching | Davide Pradovera, Ralf Hiptmair, Ilaria Perugia et.al. | [2503.10194](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194) |  |  | <details><summary>Abstract (click to expand)</summary>This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</details> |

The first SAV scheme is based on the original SAV method for the gradient flow model, while the second scheme features an updated scalar auxiliary variable to better align with the associated energy. To address the challenging constraint of pointwise constant magnetization length, an implicit projection method is designed, and verified by both SAV schemes. Both proposed SAV schemes partially preserve energy dissipation and exhibit exceptional efficiency, requiring two linear systems with constant coefficients to be solved. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by applying the Discrete Cosine Transform during the solving process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our SAV schemes outperform commonly used numerical methods in terms of both efficiency and stability.</details> |

Without the full column rank assumptions on Jacobi matrices of nonlinear systems, we provide a thorough convergence analysis, and derive upper bounds for the convergence rates of the new methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods with momentum are much more effective than the existing ones.</details> |
